title: Flow Devnet
---

Currently, there is an internal Devnet, available for access:

- [access-001.devnet14.nodes.onflow.org:9000](http://access-001.devnet14.nodes.onflow.org:9000/)

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"

func main() {
  flowAccessAddress := "access-001.devnet14.nodes.onflow.org:9000"
  flowClient, _ := client.New(flowAccessAddress, grpc.WithInsecure())

  // ...
}
```

Accounts and Tokens for testing are available by request through the Flow Faucet https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/.

- For account requests please generate ECDSA_P256 key pair and provide the public key along with your contact information then submit the form. 
- If there were no errors with your request then an email will be sent to the email specified with the address of the account created. All accounts are created with 1000 FLOW to start.
- An error email will be sent to you should there be any issues processing your request

- For token funding request please provide the address you would like to have the Flow tokens sent to along with your contact information. 
- If there were no errors with your request then an email will be sent to the email specified notifying you funds have been added to your account. 
- An error email will be sent to you should there be any issues processing your request


- Key Generation, using our `flow-go-sdk` (crypto package):

  ```go
  import (
    "crypto/rand"
  	"fmt"

    "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/crypto"
  )

  func main() {

  	// This seed must be kept safe if you want to use it to regenerate your private key
  	seed := make([]byte, crypto.MinSeedLength)

  	_, err := rand.Read(seed)
  	if err != nil {
  		panic(err)
  	}

  	// Remember to save your private key somewhere safe
  	privateKey, err := crypto.GeneratePrivateKey(crypto.ECDSA_P256, seed)
  	if err != nil {
  		panic(err)
  	}
  	// This will be your public key, and what you need to send to us
  	fmt.Printf("%x", privateKey.PublicKey().Encode())
  }
  ```

Once you receive your account, you'll be able make use of that account using our SDK. Some examples are available here in the SDK repo:

- [https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples)

Some of these examples

- `create_account`
- `deploy_contract`

Transactions will now require [fees](/token/concepts/) in order to complete.

## Important Devnet Smart Contract Addresses
