## Staking

This section describes how to run your own node and stake your own tokens for your node,
the most basic form of staking.

You first need to generate your staking key,
networking address, node ID, and networking key.
Please consult the [guide](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/node-operation-consolidated-guide) to read about how to do that.

You then need to determine the role of node you'll be running (Collector, Consensus, Execution, Verification, or Access).

Once you have determined all of this information:
* Node role (Collector, Consensus, Execution, Verification, or Access)
* Node ID
* Networking Address
* Networking Key
* Staking Key

And aquired the minimum amount of FLOW to stake for your node role:
- Collector Nodes: 250,000 FLOW
- Consensus Nodes: 500,000 FLOW
- Execution Nodes: 1,250,000 FLOW
- Verification Nodes: 135,000 FLOW

You are ready to submit a staking request.

Submit a staking request using the `create_staking_request.cdc` transaction.
providing all the node info, tokens that you want to stake, and the percentage
of delegator rewards you want to receive. (not relevant if you are not accepting delegation).
This will register your node in the Flow node identity table
and commit your tokens to stake during the next epoch.
This also stores a special node operator object in your account that is used for staking, unstaking,
and withdrawing rewards. For the rest of the epoch, you can modify your committed tokens however you
want, but they will be locked in to stake after that and will be subject to staking lockup rules.

Once the next epoch starts, if you have committed at least the minimum,
the tokens you have committed will be marked as staked and held in the protocol state.
If a staker does not meet the minimum requirement, their committed tokens are 
moved to their unlocked pool, which they can withdraw from at any time.

At anytime, you can submit a `request_unstake.cdc` transaction
which will move your tokens to the unbonding pool at the end of the current epoch.
They will sit in this pool for one (1) additional epoch,
at which point you will be able to withdraw your tokens via `withdraw_unlocked_tokens.cdc` transaction.

Staking rewards are paid at the end of every epoch. Every node's rewards
are deposited to their unlocked tokens pool. They can be withdrawn
at any time by submitting the `withdraw_reward_tokens.cdc` transaction.

You can commit more tokens to stake for the next epoch at any time,
and there are three different ways to do it.
1. You can commit new tokens to stake by submitting the `stake_new_tokens.cdc` transaction,
which withdraws tokens from your account's flow token vault and commits them.
2. You can commit tokens that are in your unlocked token pool, which holds the tokens
that you have unstaked. Submit the `stake_unlocked_tokens.cdc`
transaction to move the tokens from the unlocked pool to the committed pool.
3. You can commit tokens that are in your unlocked token pool, which holds the tokens
you have been awarded. Submit the `stake_rewarded_tokens.cdc`
transaction to move the tokens from the rewards pool to the committed pool.

## Delegating Stake

A node operator who wants to allow delegation to their node will use 
the `del_create_delegation.cdc` transaction, which creates
a public capability for prospective delegators to access to delegate to the node.

If a node operator has delegators, they cannot withdraw their own tokens 
such that their own staked tokens would fall below the minimum requirement for that node type.
This is enforced at the protocol level. If they have delegators 
and try to unstake that puts their stake below the minimum, it will fail. 

If they want to unstake below the minimum, they must unstake all of their tokens,
which also unstakes all of the tokens that have been delegated to them.

The delegation logic keeps track of the amount of tokens each delegator has delegated for the node operator.
When rewards are withdrawn, the rewards are automatically divided
based on the proportion staked by that token holder for each epoch with respect to to the total tokens staked.

### Supporting staking and delegating transactions

Token holders who wish to delegate to a node operator submit a `del_register_delegator.cdc` transaction
providing the account addresses of the node they want to delegate to.
This transaction creates a capability that the delegator stores in their account which gives them access to:

- Staking additional tokens
- Withdrawing their rewards
- Requesting to unstake their tokens

Once the user has the capability in their account, 
they can commit tokens to it to stake with the `del_stake_new_tokens.cdc` transaction.
These tokens are forwarded to the node operator's committed pool and their amount is 
recorded in the node operator's delegation state.

Similar to the regular node operator's stake,
the tokens you have committed will be marked as staked for the next epoch
and held in the protocol state for the node that was delegated to.

At anytime, a delegator can submit a `del_request_unstaking.cdc` transaction
which will move their tokens to the unbonding pool at the end of the current epoch.
They will sit in this pool for one (1) additional epoch,
at which point they will be able to withdraw their tokens via `del_withdraw_unlocked_tokens.cdc` transaction.

Every delegator's rewards are still deposited to their rewarded tokens pool.
The node operator's delegation logic tracks how much each delegator has received.
A delegator can withdraw their rewards from the unlocked tokens pool
at any time by submitting the `del_withdraw_rewarded_tokens.cdc` transaction.

Like regular node operators, delegators can also commit more tokens to stake for the next epoch
and there are two different ways to do it.
1. They can commit new tokens to stake by submitting the `del_stake_new_tokens.cdc` transaction,
which withdraws tokens from their account's flow token vault 
and commits them to the saved node operator.
2. They can commit tokens that are in their unlocked token pool, which holds 
the tokens that they have unstaked. Submit the `del_stake_unlocked.cdc`
transaction to move the tokens from the unlocked pool to the committed pool for the node.
3. They can commit tokens that are in their rewarded token pool, which holds the tokens
they have been awarded. Submit the `del_stake_rewarded.cdc`
transaction to move the tokens from the rewards pool to the committed pool for the node.

## Token Pools

Each node operator has five token pools allocated to them:

- Committed Tokens: Tokens that are committed for the next epoch. 
They are automatically moved to the staked pool when the next epoch starts.
- Staked Tokens: Tokens that are staked by the node operator for the current epoch.
They are only moved at the end of an epoch and if the staker 
has submitted an unbonding request.
- Unbonding Tokens: Tokens that have been unstaked, 
but are not free to withdraw until the following epoch. 
- Unlocked Tokens: Tokens that are freely available to withdraw or re-stake.
Unstaked tokens go to this pool.
- Rewarded Tokens: Tokens that are freely available to withdraw or re-stake. Rewards are paid and deposited to the Unlocked Pool after each epoch.
- Rewards from the epoch are deposited into the Unlocked Pool.

At the end of every epoch, tokens are moved between pools in this order:

1. All Committed Tokens will get moved either to the Staked Tokens pool, or to the Unbonded Tokens pool (depending on if the staked request has met the minimum stake).
2. All Committed Tokens get moved to staked Tokens pool.
3. All unbonding tokens get moved to the unlocked tokens pool.
4. All requested unbonding tokens get moved from the staked pool to the unbonding pool.

## Rewards

### Schedule
All rewards are automatically distributed via the staking smart contract 
to the reward pools associated with each node.
Rewards are paid out according to the following schedule:

- Initial startup phase: no rewards
- Bootstrapping phase: rewards of 20% annualized
- After bootstrapping: rewards of 3.75% annually

### Reward Payouts
Rewards are paid out at the end of each epoch (roughly a week) to the
users that have tokens staked.

The paid rewards are proportional to the stake each node operator contributes to its node group. 
Node groups are assigned rewards based on their revenue ratio 
which is a coefficient assigned to them based on the security 
they contribute to the network. 
Please connect with the Flow team directly if you'd like to understand how these coefficients are derived.

A public paper will be shared in the future.

**The reward payout on a per node basis is equal to:**

```
Reward(n_node) = ((Tr) * (Tn)) * ((Sn) / (St))
```

where:

- Tr = Sum of all the rewards paid to all nodes per epoch.
- Tn = The node role's portion of total stake.
- Sn = Amount of FLOW Staked by the node for the current Epoch.
- St = Amount of FLOW staked by all the nodes of the selected node's type.

The rewards paid for the bootstrapping phase will be roughly
5 million FLOW per epoch (per week).

Each node role's portion of total stake has been determined based on
the amount of security they contribute to the network:

- Execution Nodes comprise 7.8% of total stake (TE= 0.078)
- Collection Nodes comprise 16.8% of total stake (TL= 0.168)
- Consensus Nodes comprise 51.8% of total stake (TS=0.518)
- Verification Nodes comprise 23.6% of total stake (TV=0.236)

At network launch, there will be no more than:

3 Execution Nodes
43 Consensus Nodes
29 Collection Nodes
73 Verification Nodes (100 when performance permits)

These numbers were chosen to ensure consistent returns for running a single node of any type. 
Over time, the number of nodes will increase to promote participation 
but we don't anticipate increasing the number of participating nodes by more than double 
in the first year of the network's operation.

### Sample Rewards Calculation

Example: You are delegating 5,000 FLOW to a consensus node. If we asume there are 29 consensus nodes
active, each with the minimum amount staked. The calculation would look like this:
- Tr = 5,000,000 FLOW
- Tn = 0.518
- Sn = 5,000 FLOW
- St = (29 nodes) * (500,000 FLOW) = 
```
(Reward for Epoch) = ((5,000,000 FLOW) * (0.518)) * ((5,000 FLOW) / (14,500,000 FLOW))
                   = (2,590,000 FLOW) * 0.0003448275862
                   = ~893.1 FLOW
```

You would receive around 893.1 FLOW. Be aware that this is just an estimate based on
the expected minimum amount of consensus nodes and stake. So this will definitely change.

Accounts for receiving Rewards are conventional user accounts. 
They can be created in exactly the same account-creation process. 
Whoever is putting up the tokens to stake the node will have the right 
to select which User-Account Address will receive rewards associated with that network identity. 
In regular time intervals, the accumulated rewards a node earns are deposited into the 
rewards pool of tokens for that node. The recipient for the rewards has to withdraw the 
rewards they have received in order to store them in their own account.

## Slashing
So, who gets slashed? 
Severe slashing on Flow only takes place in the most nefarious of attacks. 
The protocol reserves slashing for maintaining the security of the protocol rather than its liveness.
You can find more details on the conditions under which a node is slashed in a different part of the docs.

While a node is in operation and during the unbonding period thereafter, 
the staked tokens are held by the staking smart contract.
Slashable protocol violations must be adjudicated by a supermajority 
of more than 2/3 of the staked consensus nodes in order to take effect.
If a node is found guilty of committing a slashable protocol violation, 
the consensus nodes directly deduct a fine from the node's stake. 
Of course, only the remaining stake is deposited back into node's balance
at the end of the unbonding period.

## FAQ
**When will the User Accounts for Node Operators be created?**
Once the network is running, we'll issue a series of transactions 
to create accounts for all the partners who are running nodes and/or building on Flow. 
While the account-creation transactions will be co-signed by Dapper Labs for authorization and paying, 
your account will be fully owned and controlled by you immediately after creation. 
Creating accounts should be possible right after network launch but 
we certainly appreciate your patience as we roll everyone's accounts out.

**What is the relationship between nodes and account addresses**
There is no formal relationship between nodes and account addresses.
When you register a node, you get an object that represents your node
and provides functionality to manage your staking, rewards, and delegation. 
This object can be stored in any account and multiple node objects can be stored 
in the same account.

It is possible for the rewards from operating multiple nodes to be deposited into the same account. 
Formally, we have a N Nodes-to-Single Account relationship, with N ≥ 1.
If you would like to subsequently disburse the received rewards to accounts of multiple parties, 
you have the full expressiveness of the Cadence smart contract language at your disposal 
to define any rules which fit your business model. 

We are happy to support you and your team with implementing the desired contracts.
