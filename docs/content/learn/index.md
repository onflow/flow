Summary: Start here if you want to dig deeper into how Flow can supercharge the experience you're building and why developers are choosing to create and innovate on Flow. 

## Accounts & Ownership 

Real ownership is a promise that individuals can access the things they value anytime, anywhere, through a broad range of service providers. This value of this promise was first validated with Bitcoin and again with Ethereum - both offering an opportunity to access value seamlessly. 

On Ethereum, interactions with anything you value requires core contract approval which is holding the value for you - your ownership is dictated by rules defined by those developers and a reference to their core smart contracts, rather than real cryptographic control.

Flow addresses this through the Account Model: a way of defining ownership and access online such that value is always available to users, protected by best-in-class security in the system, and accessible to developers - safely - meaning they can tap into user accounts to offer services but they can’t remove value from a user’s account without their express permission in the process of offering that product or service.

## The Modern Stack 

Building on Flow requires 
1 - smart contracts written in Cadence
2 - transactions sent to Flow (via FCL - the Flow Client Library)
3 - starting on Testnet 
4 - making it big on Mainnet

## Create through Composability 

Software built for composability enables a reliable, secure network of people to benefit more from working together than from competing apart. Using existing standards, building on top of popular products, enriching existing communities, or serving wholly new communities - that might otherwise be crowded out of the feature set for a more dominant user base - these are things that drastically reduce startup costs, barriers to entry, and trust required between you and new service providers. 

Flow powers an internet where people can collaborate to extend experiences and  developers can tap into standards to iterate and innovate at unprecedented speeds.
