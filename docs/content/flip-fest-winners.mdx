title: FLIP fest Winners!
---

FLIP (Flow Improvement Proposals) are a way for Flow developers and users to provide direct feedback about the improvements thye would like to see in Flow.

FLIP Fest was conducted over 3 months with over 100 developers participating in working on issues for reward bounties provided by Flow!

The following is a list of the winning projects, their respective developers, and links to their FLIP
contribution Github repositories.

## New Tools

Building on a platform like Flow is impossible without the right tools. And who better to build them than our users, who are working closely with Flow every day.
Here are the list of winning submissions in the New Tools category. Congratualtions!

### [Block explorer GUI](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/2)

### [Events indexing service](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/15)

> **Winner: Congratulations to chris615_dad2 (chriswayoub)!** 🏆

<a href="https://github.com/chriswayoub">@chriswayoub </a>

#### Challenge Summary

When an event occurs, the application will update its internal state (e.g. a database) or notify its users of the on-chain activity. Many teams have integrated event tracking systems directly into their application infrastructure, but this is a common enough problem that it warrants a simple and general-purpose solution that can serve all teams.

> **Winner: Congratulations to the Team Exponential!** 🏆

<a href="https://github.com/hichana">@hichana </a>
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/justjoolz">@justjoolz </a>

#### Challenge Summary

In the playground, the resource explorer is the tab the shows the resources inside each account. It is hidden initially and only shows up once you interact with an account's storage. But even then, it only shows up after you click an account, which usually decouples the view a transaction that updates the stored resources.

---

### Flow Playground: [Fix client-side errors in the playground frontend](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/58)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the hichana!** 🏆

While using FCL is possible in non-react example, we do not have many examples in the community of this usage. There are some issues with installing the FCL package directly due to packages used to support GRPC.

---

### FCL: [Calculate the transaction hash](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/24)

> **Winner: Congratulations to the nagato1_c511!** 🏆

<a href="https://github.com/avcdsld">@avcdsld </a>

<a href="https://github.com/hichana">@hichana </a>
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/justjoolz">@justjoolz </a>

The VS Code extension architecture could be improved so the extension becomes lighter and only handles the communication with the language server and the UI.

---

## New Standards

The Flow protocol needs a solid set of standards to help developers and users understand the protocol and how to use it.
Our FLIP fiest contributers have started the conversation around 2 very important new stardards for Flow.

### [NFT metadata](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/16)
