Flow USD (FUSD) is a stablecoin on Flow, 
issued by [Prime Trust](https://www.primetrust.com/), 
that is backed 1:1 against USD on Flow Mainnet. 

# Purpose

FUSD is a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin that is issued as a fungible 
token on the Flow network. FUSD is a fixed-price asset that provides 
a more consistently-priced experience for dapp developers and their users. 
As a valid payment token, FUSD also acts as an alternative for users 
who may not be holding the native FLOW token.
