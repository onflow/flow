Before starting your journey on Flow we recommend reading the <a href="https://www.onflow.org/primer">Flow Primer</a> where you will get a quick introduction to how the Flow blockchain works. It will be easier to understand the concepts in these tutorials if you have an idea of how Flow works.

## Install Flow

To work with Flow locally you'll need to install the <a href="https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/docs/cli.md#flow-cli">Flow CLI</a>.
The Flow CLI is a command-line interface that provides useful utilities for building Flow applications, including the Flow Emulator.

<MenuTitle>OSX & Linux</MenuTitle>

```shell
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-cli/install.sh)"
```

<MenuTitle>Windows</MenuTitle>

```powershell
iex "& { $(irm 'https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-cli/install.ps1') }"
```
