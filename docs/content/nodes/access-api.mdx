sidebar_title: Access API
---

The Access API is implemented as a [gRPC service](https://grpc.io/).

A language-agnostic specification for this API is defined using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), which can be used to generate client libraries in a variety of programming languages.

- [Flow Access API protobuf source files](https://github.com/onflow/flow/tree/master/protobuf)

## Flow access node endpoints

The Access Nodes hosted by DapperLabs are accessible at:

#### Current Mainnet
`access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`
##### We are still in the process of aggregating the past chain data but mainnet 5 to mainnet 1 spork data can be retrieved from the Access nodes mentioned [here](https://developers.flow.com/nodes/node-operation/spork#mainnet)

#### Sandboxnet

`access.sandboxnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

#### Testnet

`access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

#### Canarynet

`access.canary.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

#### Rate limits for Dapper Labs access nodes

Access nodes operated by Dapper Labs are [rate limited](/access-api-rate-limits).

```protobuf
rpc ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock (ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlockRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```

This method is a shortcut for the following:

```
header = GetLatestBlockHeader()
value = ExecuteScriptAtBlockID(header.ID, script)
```

message ExecuteScriptResponse {
  bytes value
}
```



### ExecuteScriptAtBlockID

`ExecuteScriptAtBlockID` executes a ready-only Cadence script against the execution state at the block with the given ID.

This method can be used to read account state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](/cadence/json-cadence-spec/).

```protobuf
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockID (ExecuteScriptAtBlockIDRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```


#### Request

```protobuf
message ExecuteScriptAtBlockIDRequest {
  bytes block_id
  bytes script
}
```




#### Response

```protobuf
message ExecuteScriptResponse {
  bytes value
}
```



### ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight

`ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight` executes a ready-only Cadence script against the execution state at the given block height.

```protobuf
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight (ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```


#### Request

```protobuf
message ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest {
  uint64 block_height
  bytes script
}
```

## Events

The following methods can be used to query for on-chain [events](#event).

### GetEventsForHeightRange

`GetEventsForHeightRange` retrieves [events](#event) emitted within the specified block range.

```protobuf
rpc GetEventsForHeightRange(GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest) returns (GetEventsForHeightRangeResponse)
```

Events can be requested for a specific sealed block range via the `start_height` and `end_height` (inclusive) fields and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

If `start_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return an error.

If `end_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return events up to and including the latest sealed block.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID, height and block timestamp.

Event types are name-spaced with the address of the account and contract in which they are declared.


#### Request

```protobuf
message GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest {
  string type
  uint64 start_height = 2;
  uint64 end_height = 3;
}
```




#### Response

```protobuf
message EventsResponse {
  message Result {
    bytes block_id = 1;
    uint64 block_height = 2;
    repeated entities.Event events = 3;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp block_timestamp = 4;
  }
  repeated Result results = 1;
}
```



### GetEventsForBlockIDs

`GetEventsForBlockIDs` retrieves [events](#event) for the specified block IDs and event type.

```protobuf
rpc GetEventsForBlockIDs(GetEventsForBlockIDsRequest) returns (GetEventsForBlockIDsResponse)
```

Events can be requested for a list of block IDs via the `block_ids` field and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID, height and block timestamp.


#### Request

```protobuf
message GetEventsForBlockIDsRequest {
  string type = 1;
  repeated bytes block_ids = 2;
}
```




#### Response

```protobuf
message EventsResponse {
  message Result {
    bytes block_id = 1;
    uint64 block_height = 2;
    repeated entities.Event events = 3;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp block_timestamp = 4;
  }
  repeated Result results = 1;

```protobuf
message Account {
  bytes address
  uint64 balance
  bytes code
  repeated AccountKey keys
  map<string, bytes> contracts
}
```

| Field     | Description                                                                 |

| keys      | A list of keys configured on this account                                   |
| contracts | A map of contracts or contract interfaces deployed on this account          |

The `code` and `contracts` fields contain the raw Cadence source code, encoded as UTF-8 bytes.

More information on accounts can be found [here](/concepts/accounts-and-keys/).

### Account Key

An account key is a reference to a public key associated with a Flow account. Accounts can be configured with zero or more public keys, each of which can be used for signature verification when authorizing a transaction.

```protobuf
message AccountKey {
  uint32 id
  bytes public_key
  uint32 sign_algo
  uint32 hash_algo
  uint32 weight
  uint32 sequence_number
  bool revoked
}
```

| hash_algo       | [Hash algorithm](/concepts/accounts-and-keys#supported-signature--hash-algorithms)      |
| weight          | [Weight assigned to the key](/concepts/accounts-and-keys#weighted-keys)                 |
| sequence_number | [Sequence number for the key](/concepts/accounts-and-keys#sequence-numbers)             |
| revoked         | Flag indicating whether or not the key has been revoked                                 |
