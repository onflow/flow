---

The Access API is implemented as a [gRPC service](https://grpc.io/).

A language-agnostic specification for this API is defined using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), which can be used to generate client libraries in a variety of programming languages.

- [Flow Access API protobuf source files](https://github.com/onflow/flow/tree/master/protobuf)

## Flow access node endpoints

#### Mainnet
##### We are still in the process of aggregating the past chain data but mainnet 5 to mainnet 1 spork data can be retrieved from the Access nodes mentioned [here](https://developers.flow.com/nodes/node-operation/spork#mainnet)

Production network where the Flow blockchain is running. Funds are at risk.

#### Sandboxnet

Sandboxnet mirrors mainnet and is sporked a day after the mainnet spork. It is used for testing and development.

#### Testnet

Our test environment. Funds can be fauceted freely. It is sporked 2 weeks prior to mainnet.

#### Rate limits for Dapper Labs access nodes

Access nodes operated by Dapper Labs are [rate limited](https://developers.flow.com/nodes/access-api-rate-limits).

## Events

The following methods can be used to query for on-chain [events](#event).

### GetEventsForHeightRange

`GetEventsForHeightRange` retrieves [events](#event) emitted within the specified block range.

```protobuf
rpc GetEventsForHeightRange(GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest) returns (GetEventsForHeightRangeResponse)
```

Events can be requested for a specific sealed block range via the `start_height` and `end_height` (inclusive) fields and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

If `start_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return an error.

If `end_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return events up to and including the latest sealed block.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID, height and block timestamp.

Event types are name-spaced with the address of the account and contract in which they are declared.


#### Request

```protobuf
message GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest {
  string type
  uint64 start_height = 2;
  uint64 end_height = 3;
}
```




#### Response

```protobuf
message EventsResponse {
  message Result {
    bytes block_id = 1;
    uint64 block_height = 2;
    repeated entities.Event events = 3;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp block_timestamp = 4;
  }
  repeated Result results = 1;
}
```



### GetEventsForBlockIDs

`GetEventsForBlockIDs` retrieves [events](#event) for the specified block IDs and event type.

```protobuf
rpc GetEventsForBlockIDs(GetEventsForBlockIDsRequest) returns (GetEventsForBlockIDsResponse)
```

Events can be requested for a list of block IDs via the `block_ids` field and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID, height and block timestamp.


#### Request

```protobuf
message GetEventsForBlockIDsRequest {
  string type = 1;
  repeated bytes block_ids = 2;
}
```




#### Response

```protobuf
message EventsResponse {
  message Result {
    bytes block_id = 1;
    uint64 block_height = 2;
    repeated entities.Event events = 3;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp block_timestamp = 4;
  }
  repeated Result results = 1;
}

  bytes code
  repeated AccountKey keys
  map<string, bytes> contracts
}
```

| Field     | Description                                                                 |
