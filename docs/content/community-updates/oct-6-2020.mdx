Hey folks, 

It‚Äôs been a busy week with the [NBA Top Shot Open Beta Launch!](https://www.nbatopshot.com/)

Thank you to everyone who has applied to become a node operator, contributed to the Coinlist sale, and started building on Flow - we're so happy to have you :)

Without further adieu, here‚Äôs the latest Flow update!

## Available Now - Staking, Delegation, and Locked Tokens Support

The contracts and transaction templates needed to support staking are now available and ready for you to integrate with. The team is going to be extra diligent responding to Discord questions in the coming weeks to ensure you aren‚Äôt blocked and have everything you need to support staking, delegation, and the retrieval of locked FLOW tokens, including: 

* Locked Token Accounts - this is the account you‚Äôll be creating to support the holding of / interaction with locked FLOW tokens. It creates a token admin capability inside the co-managed account. You can learn more about the dual account model for supporting locked FLOW tokens [here](/core-contracts/locked-tokens/#stakingproxy). 
 
* Staking with Locked FLOW - token holders and node operators can now stake locked FLOW tokens with the help of the [staking proxy contract](/core-contracts/). This proxy allows the node operator to run a node on behalf of the token holder without direct access to any of their funds. 

* Core Staking Contract - this is the contract that records information about staked nodes and delegators. Staking transactions that you submit to the locked token contract will be forwarded to the core staking contract.

* Delegation support - the core staking contract automatically supports delegation without additional action from you. The Staking Contract exposes a list of node operators that are valid for each epoch and populated every time a node operator both submits the minimum stake and is subsequently on the list of valid nodes for that epoch. Token holders will be able to find the list of available node operators by running the [get_proposed_table.cdc](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/transactions/idTableStaking/get_proposed_table.cdc) script and can cross check this with the Flow network approved list which is published on port.onflow.org (coming soon!) each epoch.

Jump onto the [community forum](https://forum.onflow.org/) for answers and support or onto the [Flow Discord server](https://discord.gg/CNDsZxC) for live help. 

You can find all of the documentation for locked FLOW tokens [https://docs.onflow.org/flow-token/staking](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-token/staking)
