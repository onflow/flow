---

Hey folks,

First of all - thank you all so much for your contributions to the Flow community. You being here truly makes this all possible and we canâ€™t tell you how grateful we are that youâ€™re coming on this journey with us.

Second of all - I canâ€™t tell you how much I personally appreciate your patience with us as we figure out the last details of sharing this with the world. Weâ€™re taking the time to coordinate a very special launch that we really think will broaden the possibilities for all of us and we canâ€™t wait to share it with you.

Third of all - everything following Oct 16th may be subject to change as you and the rest of the community endeavour to supporting staking on Flow. These timelines are what the Flow team recommends based on upcoming opportunities but they can of course be updated as needed. Please don't hesitate to flag concerns with the Flow team directly via hello@onflow.org or ping layne@dapperlabs.com directly (but make sure you cc hana.ito@dapperlabs.com if you want her to answer in a reasonable time frame ðŸ˜…)

So, time for a proper update!
