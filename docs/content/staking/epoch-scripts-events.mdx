# Introduction

The epoch contract stores a lot of different state, and the state is constantly changing.
As an external party, there are two ways to keep track of these state changes. 
You can either use Cadence scripts to query the state of the contract at any given time,
or you can monitor events that are emitted by the epoch contract to be notified of any important occurances.

# Monitor Epoch Service Events

These events can be queried using the Go or JavaScript SDKs to extract useful notifications and information about the
state of the epoch preparation protocol.
