# Epochs

This document describes the functionality of the [epoch smart contracts](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/contracts/epochs).
It gives an overview of the process of epochs, the staking auction, and the epoch setup and commit phases.
It is an important prerequisite to understand before proceeding with any other technical integration or interaction with the Flow Protocol,
but does not provide step-by-step instructions for how to perform specific actions.

This document also describes how to read public epoch data from the contracts.
Anyone with a Flow account on mainnet can read public data from the epoch smart contracts with these instructions.

The transactions described in this document are contained in the [`flow-core-contracts/transactions/epoch/`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/tree/master/transactions/epoch)
directory. You can see the text of all the transactions used to interact with the smart contracts there.

## Smart Contract Summary

Epoch Schedule:

TODO

The `FlowEpoch` contract manages all of these phases, the `FlowIDTableStaking` contract
manages the identity table and staking auction, the `FlowClusterQC` contract manages
the Quorum Certificate generation for collector clusters, and the `FlowDKG` contract manages
the Distributed Key Generation protocol for the consensus nodes.

Initially, control of these phases and contracts will be managed manually by the Flow Token Admin,
but control will eventually be completely decentralized and managed by the node software, smart contracts,
and democratically by all the stakers in the network.
