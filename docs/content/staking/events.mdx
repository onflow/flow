# Introduction

The resources used in node registration and for staking FLOW tokens emit events whenever an important action is performed.

These events can be queried using the Go or JavaScript SDKs to extract useful notifications and information about the
state of the staking process.

# Querying Events

To query events you will need to connect to a Flow access node using the SDK for the language that you are using.

## Go SDK

You can find the Go SDK for Flow here:

[https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk)

Documentation for how to handle events can be found here:

[https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-events](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk#querying-events)

And sample code for doing so is here:

[https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples/query_events](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples/query_events)

## JavaScript SDK

You can find the JavaScript SDK for Flow here:

[https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk)

Documentation and sample code for handling events are forthcoming.

# Event Descriptions

## Node Events

These are events that concern the operation of a node.

### NewNodeCreated

```cadence
pub event NewNodeCreated(nodeID: String, role: UInt8, amountCommitted: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type    | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| nodeID          | String  | The unique ID string for the node. 32 bytes. Usually the hash of the node's public key. |
| role            | UInt8   | The node's role type. From 1 to 5 inclusive. For the meaning of the values see [https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/contracts/FlowIDTableStaking.cdc](FlowIDTableStaking.cdc) |
| amountCommitted | UFix64  | The amount of FLOW tokens staked to register the node. This is determined by the `role`. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeRecord.init()` when a new node is successfully created.

After this event is emitted for your node, you can begin to perform staking transactions using it.

### NodeRemovedAndRefunded

```cadence
pub event NodeRemovedAndRefunded(nodeID: String, amount: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type    | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| nodeID          | String  | The unique ID string for the node. 32 bytes. The same value emitted in the `NewNodeCreated` event for the node. |
| amount          | UFix64  | The amount of FLOW tokens returned to the node. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.endStakingAuction()` if the node is being removed from the next epoch due to the tokens that they have committed
for the next epoch not meeting the minimum requirements.

After this event the refunded FLOW tokens will be part of the node's `tokensUnstaked` balance.

## Token Events

These are events that concern the direct usage of FLOW tokens - staking or unstaking locked tokens, widthdrawing rewards, etc.

Events emitted when using delegation are described in the next section.

### TokensCommitted

```cadence
pub event TokensCommitted(nodeID: String, amount: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type    | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| nodeID          | String  | The unique ID string for the node. 32 bytes. The same value emitted in the `NewNodeCreated` event for the node. |
| amount          | UFix64  | The amount of additional FLOW tokens committed to the node. |

Emitted whenever additional tokens are staked on the node for the following epoch. Specifically:
1. By `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeStaker.stakeNewTokens()` when new tokens (tokens that have not previously been staked) are added to the system
to stake on the node during the next epoch.
2. By `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeStaker.stakeUnstakedTokens()` when unstaked tokens (tokens that were previously staked and then unstaked)
are staked again with the node for the next epoch.
3. By `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeStaker.stakeRewardedTokens()` when reward tokens (tokens paid in return for previous staking)
are staked with the node for the next epoch.

After this event the FLOW tokens will be part of the node's `tokensCommitted` balance.

### TokensStaked

```cadence
pub event TokensStaked(nodeID: String, amount: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type    | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| nodeID          | String  | The unique ID string for the node. 32 bytes. The same value emitted in the `NewNodeCreated` event for the node. |
| amount          | UFix64  | The amount of FLOW tokens staked to the node. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.moveTokens()` at the end of an epoch if committed tokens are being returned to the node's tokensStaked balance.

After this event the tokens will be part of the node's staked balance.

### TokensUnstaking

```cadence
pub event TokensUnstaking(nodeID: String, amount: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type    | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| nodeID          | String  | The unique ID string for the node. 32 bytes. The same value emitted in the `NewNodeCreated` event for the node. |
| amount          | UFix64  | The amount of FLOW tokens unstaked from the node. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.moveTokens()` at the end of an epoch if either:
1. A node operator's staked tokens are being unstaked in response from a request from the node operator to do so. After this event the tokens will be a part of the node operator's tokensUnstaking balanwce.
2. A delegator's staked tokens are being unstaked in response from a request from the delegator to do so. After this event the tokens will be a part of the node delegator's tokensUnstaking balance.

### RewardsPaid

```cadence
pub event RewardsPaid(nodeID: String, amount: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type    | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| nodeID          | String  | The unique ID string for the node. 32 bytes. The same value emitted in the `NewNodeCreated` event for the node. |
| amount          | UFix64  | The amount of FLOW tokens paid to the node this epoch as a reward. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.payRewards()` at the end of the epoch to pay rewards to node operators based on the tokens that they have staked.

After this event the reward tokens will be part of the node's tokensRewarded balance.

The Delegator rewards are paid at the same time, see `DelegatorRewardsPaid` below.

### UnstakedTokensWithdrawn

```cadence
pub event UnstakedTokensWithdrawn(nodeID: String, amount: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type    | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|

| amount          | UFix64  | The amount of unstaked FLOW tokens that the node operator is withdrawing. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeStaker.withdrawUnstakedTokens()` when the node operator calls that function to withdraw part or all of their
unstaked tokens balance.

After this event the FLOW tokens have been withdrawn to a newly created `FungibleToken.Vault` which the caller can deposit to the vault of their choice.

### RewardTokensWithdrawn

```cadence
pub event RewardTokensWithdrawn(nodeID: String, amount: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type    | Description |

| amount          | UFix64  | The amount of reward FLOW tokens that the node operator is withdrawing. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeStaker.withdrawRewardedTokens()` when the node operator calls that function to withdraw part or all of their
reward tokens balance.

After this event the FLOW tokens have been withdrawn to a newly created `FungibleToken.Vault` which the caller can deposit to the vault of their choice.

## Delegator Events

These are events that concern FLOW token delegation.

|------------------|---------|-------------|
| newCutPercentage | UFix64  | The percentage of the delegator reward that goes to node operators. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.changeCutPercentage()` when the Admin changes the percentage of delegator rewards that every node operator takes.

Note that the percentage will be more than 0.0 and less than 1.0, with the actual percentage equal to this multiplied by 100.

Also note that the percentage is taken from the *delegator* reward to go to the *node operator*.

After this event the nodeDelegatingRewardCut is equal to the new value.
