description: Introduction to how staking works on Flow

This document provides an introduction to staking FLOW tokens on the Flow network for token holders and node operators.

## What is Staking?

A blockchain is a global network of computers working together
to maintain the security and integrity of a shared state that applications and people around the world use. 
Every node operator has a small part of the responsibility to keep the network running smoothly 
and to ensure that other node operators are doing the same. 
This large distribution of resources makes it so that control is never centralized 
under one person or organization.

What is to stop these node operators from misbehaving and stealing someone else’s money 
or modifying the state of the network in an unauthorized way? Staking! 
Every node operator has to temporarily give (or ‘stake’) 
a large number of their tokens to the network as a promise that they will behave. 

This process is called staking. 
If a node ever misbehaves, a number of their staked tokens will be taken from them as a punishment.
This incentivizes all the node operators to behave with the interests of all the users of the network in mind. 
Every node watches other nodes and reports them if they misbehave. 

If nodes maintain the network well and never misbehave, the protocol pays them rewards on a regular basis!

# How does Staking work in Flow?

The Flow protocol maintains a list of node operators. 
The list contains important information about each node, like their public keys, node address, 
and what kind of node they are running. 
(Collection, Consensus, Execution, Verification, or Access)

To register their node, the node operator submits a transaction to register their node along with tokens they want to stake.

Once a node operator is registered and staked, assuming they keep their node online, are well behaved, 
and are consistent maintainers of the network, they receive rewards at the end of every week. 
This timeframe of earning rewards is otherwise known as an Epoch.

# Epochs

An epoch is a week-long period that the network uses to manage the stakers and pay rewards.
Every epoch, a list of committed nodes are chosen to be the staked nodes of the network, 
and their staked tokens are locked in and cannot change for the duration of the epoch. 
At the end of the epoch, rewards are paid to each node based on how many tokens they had staked for that epoch. 
This process repeats itself indefinitely, as long as the network remains functioning.

To determine the list of nodes that are included as officially staked nodes in the next epoch, 
the protocol looks at the records of all the nodes that have committed tokens. 
It checks to make sure each node’s information is correct and that the node is running properly. 
Each node also has to have committed tokens above the minimum stake required for their node. 
If any of these checks are insufficient, the node is not included in the next epoch. 
If a node passes all the checks, they are approved and included as an official node for the next epoch.

Nodes do not have to continue to submit staking registration transactions every epoch in order to remain staked. 
As long as they continue to run their node properly, their tokens will remain staked. 
A node operator only needs to take action if they want to stake more tokens or if they want to unstake their staked tokens. 
If a node operator decides to stake or unstake tokens, 
their requests are not carried out until the end of the current epoch.
In the case of unstaking requests, they also must wait an additional epoch before their unstaked tokens are available to withdraw.

# Rewards

Please see the [Rewards](/staking/rewards) section of the documentation for information about reward calculations and schedule.

# Delegation
Any account in the network may also participate in staking by delegating their tokens to a node operator. 
Every node operator in the network is eligible to receive delegation, there is no opting out. 

To delegate to a node, a user simply specifies the ID of the node they want to delegate to 
and the amount of tokens they want to delegate. 
The tokens are committed and managed in the exact same way that normal staked tokens are managed. 

Rewards for delegators are also calculated in the exact same way that rewards for node operators are calculated, 
with one difference in that 8% of the calculated amount is given to the node operator being delegated to. 
The remaining 92% is awarded to the delegator.

# How Do I Stake?

So you have decided you want to be a part of the Flow Protocol. Welcome! 
You are joining a group of people from all around the world that are a part of a movement centered
around bringing decentralization and transparency into the world.

## Developers

If you are a developer or other technically-minded person and want to learn more detail
about the inner workings of the identity table and staking protocol, please see 
the [staking technical documentation](../technical-overview).

## Staking via a Custody Provider

If you are using a custody provider who controls your account and private keys for you, 
such as Kraken, Finoa, or Coinlist, they all have different policies and processes 
for what you need to do to stake your tokens, the rewards you receive, 
and the fees that they take from your staking rewards. 
Please reach out to them if you have any questions about staking your tokens with your provider.

## Manual Staking

If you are self-custodying your account and keys, you will need to learn more about how staking works
and how you can participate safely and reliably. 
See the manual staking documentation for information about how you can use your FLOW 
to stake with the network via Flow Port.
