description: Introduction to how staking works on Flow

This document provides an introduction to staking FLOW tokens on the Flow network for token holders and node operators.
Staking is an important part of the security of a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.
Running nodes and staking tokens contributes to this security and is rewarded accordingly.


## What is Staking?

Flow is a global network of computers working together
to maintain the security and integrity of it's user's data.

This global network is made up of many individual nodes. Every node in the network shares a small part of the responsibility to keep the network running smoothly 
and to ensure that other nodes are doing the same. This shared responsibility is sometimes called decentralization, because no single node is responsible for th e security and integrity of the network and the data it contains.

Nodes in the network are software applications run by people, we call them node operators. To connect a Node to the network a node operator must first purchase some tokens. Every node operator has to temporarily give (or ‘stake’) 
a large number of their tokens to the network as a promise that they will not modify their node to do something that is against the rules of the network, like steal funds from user's accounts.

If a node ever breaks the rules defined by the network, a number of the node operator's staked tokens will be taken from them as a punishment.
This process is automatic. Every node knows the rules defined by the network and automatically watches other nodes and reports them if they misbehave. Meanwhile, the network pays the node operator a reward of tokens on a regular basis, if their node does not break the rules.

If I break the rules, I loose the tokens I've staked. If I operate my node with integrity, I get rewarded with more tokens! This is the basic incentive that enables a decentralized proof-of-stake network, like Flow.

## How does Staking work in Flow?

The Flow protocol maintains a list of node operators. 
The list contains important information about each node, like their public keys, node address, 
and what kind of node they are running. 
(Collection, Consensus, Execution, Verification, or Access)

To register their node, the node operator submits a transaction to register their node along with tokens they want to stake.

Once a node operator is registered and staked, assuming they keep their node online, are well behaved, 
and are consistent maintainers of the network, they receive rewards at the end of every week. 
This timeframe of earning rewards is otherwise known as an Epoch.

### Epochs

An epoch is a week-long period that the network uses to manage the stakers and pay rewards.
Every epoch, a list of committed nodes are chosen to be the staked nodes of the network, 
and their staked tokens are locked in and cannot change for the duration of the epoch. 
At the end of the epoch, rewards are paid to each node based on how many tokens they had staked for that epoch. 
This process repeats itself indefinitely, as long as the network remains functioning.

To determine the list of nodes that are included as officially staked nodes in the next epoch, 
the protocol looks at the records of all the nodes that have committed tokens. 
It checks to make sure each node’s information is correct and that the node is running properly. 
Each node also has to have committed tokens above the minimum stake required for their node. 
If any of these checks are insufficient, the node is not included in the next epoch. 
If a node passes all the checks, they are approved and included as an official node for the next epoch.

Nodes do not have to continue to submit staking registration transactions every epoch in order to remain staked. 
As long as they continue to run their node properly, their tokens will remain staked. 
A node operator only needs to take action if they want to stake more tokens or if they want to unstake their staked tokens. 
If a node operator decides to stake or unstake tokens, 
their requests are not carried out until the end of the current epoch.
In the case of unstaking requests, they also must wait an additional epoch before their unstaked tokens are available to withdraw.

### Rewards

Please see the [Rewards](/staking/rewards) section of the documentation for information about reward calculations and schedule.

## Delegation
Any account in the network may also participate in staking by delegating their tokens to a node operator. 
Every node operator in the network is eligible to receive delegation, there is no opting out. 

To delegate to a node, a user simply specifies the ID of the node they want to delegate to 
and the amount of tokens they want to delegate. 
The tokens are committed and managed in the exact same way that normal staked tokens are managed. 

Rewards for delegators are also calculated in the exact same way that rewards for node operators are calculated, 
with one difference in that 8% of the calculated amount is given to the node operator being delegated to. 
The remaining 92% is awarded to the delegator.

## How Do I Stake?

So you have decided you want to be a part of the Flow network. Welcome! 
You are joining a group of people from all around the world that are a part of a movement that is bringing decentralization and transparency into the world.

### Staking via a Custody Provider

If you are using a custody provider who controls your account and private keys for you, 
such as Kraken, Finoa, or Coinlist, they all have different policies and processes 
for what you need to do to stake your tokens, the rewards you receive, 
and the fees that they take from your staking rewards. 
Please reach out to them if you have any questions about staking your tokens with your provider.

### Manual Staking

If you are self-custodying your Flow account and keys, you will need to learn more about how staking works
and how you can participate safely and reliably. 
See the manual staking documentation for information about how you can use your FLOW tokens
to stake with the network via Flow Port.
