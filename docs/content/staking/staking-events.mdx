# Introduction

The resources used in node registration and for staking FLOW tokens emit events whenever an important action is performed.

These events can be queried using the Go or JavaScript SDKs to extract useful notifications and information about the
state of the staking process.

## Global Staking and Epoch Events

### NewEpoch

```cadence
pub event NewEpoch(totalStaked: UFix64, totalRewardPayout: UFix64)
```

| Field             | Type   | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| totalStaked       | UFix64 | The total number of tokens staked for the new Epoch                    |
| totalRewardPayout | UFix64 | The total number of tokens that will be paid as rewards for this epoch |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.moveTokens()` when the tokens are moved between pools, which signals a new epoch.

### NewWeeklyPayout

```cadence
pub event NewWeeklyPayout(newPayout: UFix64)
```

| Field     | Type   | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| newPayout | UFix64 | The new number of tokens that will be paid at the end of the epoch |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.setEpochTokenPayout()` when the Admin changes the total tokens paid at the end of the epoch.

After this event the `epochTokenPayout` is equal to the new value.

### NewStakingMinimums

```cadence
pub event NewStakingMinimums(newMinimums: {UInt8: UFix64})
```

| Field           | Type            | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| newRequirements | {UInt8: UFix64} | The new minimum staking requirements for all the node types. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.setMinimumStakeRequirements()` when the Admin changes the minimum requirements for node types.

### NewDelegatorCutPercentage

```cadence
pub event NewDelegatorCutPercentage(newCutPercentage: UFix64)
```

| Field            | Type   | Description                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| newCutPercentage | UFix64 | The percentage of the delegator reward that goes to node operators. |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.setCutPercentage()` when the Admin changes the percentage of delegator rewards that every node operator takes.

Note that the percentage will be more than 0.0 and less than 1.0, with the actual percentage equal to this multiplied by 100.

Also note that the percentage is taken from the _delegator_ reward to go to the _node operator_.

After this event the nodeDelegatingRewardCut is equal to the new value.

## Node Events

These are events that concern the operation of a node.

### NewNodeCreated

```cadence
pub event NewNodeCreated(nodeID: String, role: UInt8, amountCommitted: UFix64)
```

| Field           | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| role            | UInt8  | The node's role type. From 1 to 5 inclusive. For the meaning of the values see [FlowIDTableStaking.cdc](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/contracts/FlowIDTableStaking.cdc) |
| amountCommitted | UFix64 | The amount of FLOW tokens staked to register the node. This is determined by the `role`.                                                                                                            |

After this event is emitted for your node, you can begin to perform staking transactions using it.

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.endStakingAuction()` if the node is being removed from the next epoch
due to a failure to meet the minimum requirements of committed tokens for the next epoch.

After this event, the refunded FLOW tokens will be part of the node's `tokensUnstaked` balance.

## Token Events

These are events that concern the direct usage of FLOW tokens - staking or unstaking locked tokens, withdrawing rewards, etc.

Events emitted when using delegation are described in the next section.

1. By `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeStaker.stakeNewTokens()` when new tokens (tokens that have not previously been staked) are added to the system
   to stake on the node during the next epoch.
2. By `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeStaker.stakeUnstakedTokens()` when unstaked tokens (tokens that were previously staked and then unstaked)
   are staked again with the node for the next epoch.
3. By `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeStaker.stakeRewardedTokens()` when reward tokens (tokens paid in return for previous staking)
   are staked with the node for the next epoch.

After this event, the FLOW tokens will be part of the node's `tokensCommitted` balance.

| nodeID      | String | The unique ID string for the node. 32 bytes. The same value emitted in the `NewNodeCreated` event for the node. |
| delegatorID | UFix64 | The ID for the delegator. Unique within the node but not globally.                                              |
| amount      | UFix64 | The amount of rewarded FLOW tokens that the delegator is withdrawing.                                           |

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.NodeDelegator.withdrawRewardedTokens()` when the delegator calls that function to withdraw part or all of their
unstaked tokens balance.

After this event, the FLOW tokens will be withdrawn to a newly created `FungibleToken.Vault` which the caller can deposit to the vault of their choice.
