title: How to Delegate with Locked FLOW
sidebar_title: Delegate with Locked FLOW
---

This document outlines the steps a token holder can take to delegate locked FLOW tokens to 
another node using the `LockedTokens` contract.

<Callout type="warning">

This guide covers delegation with _**locked FLOW tokens**_. 
A separate guide for unlocked tokens will be published at a later date.
</Callout>

# Setup

## Prerequisites

The token holder must [configure their account to hold locked FLOW](/token/locked-account-setup) 
before they are able to complete the steps below. After this is complete, 
the `LockedTokens.TokenHolder` can be used to perform staking operations from the account.

## Register as a Delegator

To register as a delegator, the token holder can use the **Register Delegator** ([TH.17](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **id**     | `String` | The ID of the node to delegate to. |
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

This transaction registers the account as a delegator to the node ID they specified
and attaches a `NodeDelegatorProxy` capability to the `TokenHolder` resource. 
This capability can later be used to perform delegation actions.

Once an account has registered as a delegator with one node, they cannot register with any others. 
For more information, see [Delegate to Multiple Nodes from the Same Account](#delegate-to-multiple-nodes-from-the-same-account) below.
This feature will be added in the future.

# Delegation Actions

## Delegate New Tokens

The token holder can delegate additional tokens after registering as a delegator. 

_Note: This transaction delegates additional tokens to the same node that was registered in the setup phase.
It is currently not possible to [delegate to multiple nodes from the same account](#delegate-to-multiple-nodes-from-the-same-account)._

To delegate new tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the token holder can use the **Delegate New Locked FLOW** ([TH.19](../transactions/#token-holder)) 
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Re-delegate Unstaked Tokens

After delegated tokens become unstaked, the token holder can choose to re-delegate the unstaked tokens to the same node.

To delegate unstaked tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the token holder can use the **Re-delegate Unstaked FLOW** ([TH.20](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of unstaked FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Re-delegate Rewarded Tokens

After earning rewards from delegation, the token holder can choose to re-delegate the rewarded tokens to the same node.

To delegate rewarded tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the token holder can use the **Re-delegate Rewarded FLOW** ([TH.21](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of rewarded FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Unstake Delegated Tokens

The token holder can submit a request to unstake their delegated tokens at any time.

To unstake delegated tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the token holder can use the **Unstake Delegated FOW** ([TH.22](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to unstake. |

_Note: unstaked delegated tokens will be held by the central staking contract for a period of time 
(the rest of the current epoch plus all of the next epoch) before they are 
released to the token holder. Once the tokens are released (unstaked), 
they can be claimed via the [Withdraw Unstaked Tokens](#withdraw-unstaked-tokens) action below._

## Withdraw Unstaked Tokens

After delegated tokens become unstaked, the token holder can withdraw them from the central staking contract.

To withdraw unstaked tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the token holder can use the **Withdraw Unstaked FLOW ** ([TH.23](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of unstaked FLOW tokens to withdraw. |

This transaction moves the unstaked tokens back into the `LockedTokens.Lockbox` owned by the token holder.

## Withdraw Rewarded Tokens

After earning rewards from delegation, the token holder can withdraw them from the central staking contract.

To withdraw rewarded tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the token holder can use the **Withdraw Rewarded FLOW** ([TH.24](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of rewarded FLOW tokens to withdraw. |

This transaction moves the rewarded tokens back into the `LockedTokens.Lockbox` owned by the token holder. 
However, unlike unstaked tokens, rewards are _unlocked FLOW_ and can be immediately withdrawn from the lockbox.

## Query a Delegator Record

To return a struct with all the information associated with a delegator, anyone
can use the **Get Delegator Info** ([TH.21](../transactions/#token-holder)) script with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **nodeID** | `String` | The 32 byte ID of the node of the delegator |
| **nodeID** | `UInt8`  | The ID of the delegator |

This script returns a `FlowIDTableStaking.DelegatorInfo` [struct.](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/contracts/FlowIDTableStaking.cdc#L348)

## Delegate to Multiple Nodes from the Same Account

Currently, the `LockedTokens` contract only supports token holders delegating to a single node.

If a token holder wants to create a second delegation relationship, they must create a new account
and transfer their locked tokens to the new account by requesting authorization from the token admin.

We plan on adding functionality in the future to allow accounts to delegate to multiple nodes.
