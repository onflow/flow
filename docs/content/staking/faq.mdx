### Where will users receive their staking reward for each staking option?

If you staked using Flow Port, then you should be able to see your staking rewards there. You can also withdraw the rewards or manually re-stake them through Flow Port.

If you staked using a staking provider such as Kraken, Blocto or Finoa, they should be able to provide you with more details on how to receive the staking reward.

### Will staking rewards be automatically re-staked?

There will be *no* automatic re-staking of staking rewards with Flow Port (i.e. using Ledger or Blocto).

If you staked using a staking provider such as Kraken, Blocto or Finoa, they should be able to provide you with more details.

### Can a validator change its fees?

For the beta period weâ€™re enforcing a minimum delegation fee of 8% which cannot be changed.

### Can a token holder stake to multiple nodes? If yes, how is the stake split between them?

A token holder will be able to stake multiple nodes in the future.
However, currently there is a restriction in place from the token lockup rules such that there is a 1-to-1 relationship between an account address and an active stake.
We have the same restriction in place for an account address and an active delegation.
This means that 1 account address can have at maximum 1 active stake and 1 active delegation at any given time.
If a token holder wants to have additional stake and/or delegate transactions, then they must create additional account addresses to do so.
