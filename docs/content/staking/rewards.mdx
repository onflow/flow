# Rewards

Rewards are paid out at the end of each epoch to all the users that have tokens staked. 

## Calculation

Each user gets a percentage of the rewards that is equal to their percentage of all the tokens that are staked by all users.

The full reward calculation on a per user basis is equal to:

```
New Reward(user) = Tr  * (Sn / St)
```

where:
- `Tr` = Sum of all the rewards paid to all users for the current epoch.
- `Sn` = Amount of FLOW Staked by the user for the current Epoch.
- `St` = Sum of all the FLOW staked by all the stakers in the network.

Rewards for delegators are also calculated in the exact same way 
that rewards for node operators are calculated, 
with one difference in that 8% of the calculated amount 
is given to the node operator being delegated to. 
The remaining 92% is awarded to the delegator.

## Rewards Schedule:

The total rewards paid each epoch will change based on the inflation schedule 
that has been determined in order to maximize the distribution of FLOW 
and ensure enough liquidity for token holders. 

- Weeks 1-2: 5% Inflation: ~1.1 Million FLOW rewarded per week
- Weeks 3-6: 20% Inflation: ~4.4 Million FLOW rewarded per week
- Weeks 7-18: 5% Inflation: ~1.2 Million FLOW rewarded per week
