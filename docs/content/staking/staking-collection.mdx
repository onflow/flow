This document outlines the steps a token holder can take to stake using the `FlowIDTableStaking` contract
and the `FlowStakingCollection` contract. This is the recommended and most supported way to stake FLOW.
It supprts any number of nodes and delegators per account, supprts locked and unlocked FLOW,
and supports easily interaction with a node's machine account for collector and consensus nodes.

This guide covers the transactions a user can utilize to set up
