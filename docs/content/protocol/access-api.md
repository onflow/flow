title: Flow Access API Specification
sidebar_title: Access API
---

The Access API is implemented as a [gRPC service](https://grpc.io/).

A language-agnostic specification for this API is defined using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), which can be used to generate client libraries in a variety of programming languages.

- [Flow Access API protobuf source files](https://github.com/onflow/flow/tree/master/protobuf)

## Ping

`Ping` will return a successful response if the Access API is ready and available.

## Accounts

### GetAccount

`GetAccount` gets an [account](#account) by address at the latest sealed block.

⚠️ Warning: this function is deprecated. It behaves identically to `GetAccountAtLatestBlock` and will be removed in a future version.

```protobuf
rpc GetAccount(GetAccountRequest) returns (GetAccountResponse)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message GetAccountRequest {

## Scripts

### ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock

`ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock` executes a read-only Cadence script against the latest sealed execution state.

This method can be used to read execution state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](/docs/json-cadence-spec.md).

```protobuf
rpc ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock (ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlockRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```

This method is a shortcut for the following:

```
header = GetLatestBlockHeader()
value = ExecuteScriptAtBlockID(header.ID, script)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlockRequest {
    bytes script
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message ExecuteScriptResponse {
    bytes value
  }
  ```
</details>

### ExecuteScriptAtBlockID

`ExecuteScriptAtBlockID` executes a ready-only Cadence script against the execution state at the block with the given ID.

This method can be used to read account state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](/docs/cadence-json-spec.md).

```protobuf
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockID (ExecuteScriptAtBlockIDRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message ExecuteScriptAtBlockIDRequest {
    bytes block_id
    bytes script

  }
  ```
</details>

### ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight

`ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight` executes a ready-only Cadence script against the execution state at the given block height.

This method can be used to read account state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](/docs/cadence-json-spec.md).

```protobuf
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight (ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest {
    uint64 block_height
    bytes script
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>

## Events

The following methods can be used to query for on-chain [events](#event).

### GetEventsForHeightRange

`GetEventsForHeightRange` retrieves [events](#event) emitted within the specified block range.

```protobuf
rpc GetEventsForHeightRange(GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest) returns (GetEventsForHeightRangeResponse)
```

Events can be requested for a specific sealed block range via the `start_height` and `end_height` (inclusive) fields and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

If `end_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return events up to and including the latest sealed block.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID, height and block timestamp.

Event types are name-spaced with the address of the account and contract in which they are declared.

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest {
    string type
    uint64 start_height = 2;
    uint64 end_height = 3;
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message EventsResponse {
    message Result {
      bytes block_id = 1;
      uint64 block_height = 2;
      repeated entities.Event events = 3;
      google.protobuf.Timestamp block_timestamp = 4;
    }
    repeated Result results = 1;
  }
  ```
</details>

### GetEventsForBlockIDs

`GetEventsForBlockIDs` retrieves [events](#event) for the specified block IDs and event type.

```protobuf
rpc GetEventsForBlockIDs(GetEventsForBlockIDsRequest) returns (GetEventsForBlockIDsResponse)
```

Events can be requested for a list of block IDs via the `block_ids` field and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID, height and block timestamp.

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message GetEventsForBlockIDsRequest {
    string type = 1;
    repeated bytes block_ids = 2;
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>

  ```protobuf
  message EventsResponse {
    message Result {
      bytes block_id = 1;
      uint64 block_height = 2;
      repeated entities.Event events = 3;
      google.protobuf.Timestamp block_timestamp = 4;
    }
    repeated Result results = 1;
  }
  ```
</details>
