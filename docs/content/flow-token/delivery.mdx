#### For CoinList Backers

If you participated through CoinList, it is the default option, meaning your tokens will be deposited there if you do not take any action. To receive your tokens through another custodian or wallet provider, you must create a Flow address by following the steps outlined below.

#### For Convertible Note Backers

To receive your tokens you must create a Flow address by following the steps outlined by your chosen provider.

#### For Community Participants

To receive your tokens you must create a Flow address by following the steps outlined by your chosen provider.

#### For Flow Lease Recipients

Leased FLOW accounts are only provided by Ledger or Blocto. To receive your leased FLOW, you must create a Flow address by following the steps outlined by your chosen provider. [Read more.](/staking/custody-providers/). Leased FLOW accounts are created in the exact same way as regular locked token accounts. If you are receiving a token lease and any other type of token allocation, you will need to create multiple accounts. The token lease needs to be in its own account.

Below are 5 different ways to create an account and receive your FLOW tokens.

## CoinList

CoinList will support the distribution, storage and staking of FLOW through CoinList Wallets. By default your purchase of FLOW will be distributed to your CoinList Wallet. There are no actions required to receive your FLOW distribution to your CoinList wallet.

**CoinList Wallets**

CoinList wallets are built on secure custody and technology infrastructure provided by our partner custodians including Anchorage, Bitgo, Gemini Custody, and Finoa. If you decide to use CoinList Wallets, your FLOW will be held at Finoa.

Upon distribution, your FLOW will be held with our custody providers and you will be available to view your FLOW balance through your CoinList wallet. Your FLOW will be available for transfer and trading at the end of the applicable lock-up and vesting periods.

There is no cost to use CoinList wallets or to store your FLOW with CoinList.

Please note, you will not be able to withdraw staking rewards and we do not anticipate supporting withdrawals or deposits support for FLOW before the end of Q4 2020.

## Kraken
