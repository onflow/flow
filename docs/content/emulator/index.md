The Flow Emulator is a lightweight tool that emulates the behaviour of the real Flow network.

The emulator exposes a gRPC server that implements the Flow Access API,
which is designed to have near feature parity with the real network API.

## Running the emulator with the Flow CLI

The emulator is bundled with the [Flow CLI](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli), a command-line interface for working with Flow.

### Installation

Follow [these steps](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/) to install the Flow CLI on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Usage

To learn more about using the Emulator,
have a look at [the README of the repository](https://github.com/onflow/flow-emulator/#starting-the-server).
