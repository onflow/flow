# Flow Glossary

## All words and definitions related to Blockchain and Flow

## **A**

## Authentication
[Authentication](https://developers.flow.com/tools/fcl-js/reference/authentication)  verifies whether someone is who they say they are. Once verified, the user gains access to their wallet. 
FCL supports authentication so users can connect to Flow apps with their wallets.

## Authorization
Authorization is a process by which a server determines if the client has permission to use a resource or access a file. 
Users can authorize actions by signing transactions. FCL supports transaction signing.

## Authorization Envelope
The authorization of a transaction is captured in an “authorization envelope”, which 
contains both the [transaction payload](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/transaction-signing/#payload) and the payload signatures.

## Authorizers
[Authorizers](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-go-sdk/#transactions) are accounts that authorize a transaction to read and mutate their 
resources. A transaction can specify zero or more authorizers, depending on how many accounts the transaction needs to access.

## Account
An [account](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/accounts-and-keys/#accounts) on Flow is a record in the chain state that holds 
the address, balance, public keys, Cadence contracts deployed to the account, and storage.

## Account balance
The [account balance](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/accounts-and-keys/#accounts) is the number of tokens available in your 
wallet. 

## Account storage
The area of the [account](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/accounts/#account-storage) used to store resource assets.

## Address
A blockchain address is like a bank account for crypto assets. Every address is unique, and they are 26-35 alphanumeric characters in length. 
They are generated from the private key, which is required to send or receive data from one address to another.

## Access node
[Access nodes](https://docs.onflow.org/nodes/node-operation/node-roles/#access) act as a proxy to the Flow network. The Access node routes
transactions to the correct Collection node and routes state queries to available nodes (while likely caching state to answer queries 
on time in the future).

## **B**

## Block
[Blocks](https://portto.com/) are data structures within the blockchain, where transaction data in a blockchain are permanently recorded.

## Blocto
[Blocto](https://portto.com/) is a wallet that can handle authentication and authorization and is meant to address long-standing issues with private key management, 
transaction fees, and complicated wallet addresses.

## Blockchain
[Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05821.pdf) is an organized collection of information that typically encrypts and stores its data in block form and then chains them 
together, making it difficult to hack, change, or cheat; also, it is immutable.

## Block explorer
Block explorer is an interface that allows users to search for information from the blockchain,
which includes retrieving individual transactions, activity associated with specific addresses, 
and information about the network. There are two Flow block explorers available [Flowscan](https://flowscan.org/) 
and [Bigdipper](https://flow.bigdipper.live/).

## **C**

## Cadence
[Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/) is a resource-oriented programming language for developing smart contracts on the 
Flow Blockchain.

## Capability
[Capability](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/tutorial/04-capabilities/) in Flow makes it easy for anyone to access 
specific fields and functions of a stored object. 

## CLI
A command-line interpreter can  receive commands from a user through lines of text. Developers are using CLIs to interact with programs or the operating system.

## Contract
A [contract](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/contracts/) in Cadence is a collection of type definitions of 
interfaces, structs, resources, data (its state), and code (its functions) that lives in the contract storage area of an account in Flow.

## Collection nodes
[Collection](https://docs.onflow.org/nodes/node-operation/node-roles/#collection) nodes are bandwidth-optimized nodes divided by the protocol
into several cooperating Clusters.

## Consensus
[Consensus](https://docs.onflow.org/nodes/node-operation/node-roles/#consensus) nodes form and propose blocks like traditionally-structured
proof-of-stake blockchains, using the HotStuff consensus algorithm to create a globally consistent chain of blocks.

## Custodial model
The [custodial model](https://docs.onflow.org/nft-marketplace/#custodial-vs-non-custodial-model) for an NFT marketplace is where the 
platform controls all the user accounts, the associated private keys, and, therefore, the assets in those accounts.

## **D**

## Dapper wallet
The [Dapper wallet](https://www.meetdapper.com/) is a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their Flow accounts.

## Dapp
A decentralized application (dapp) is a distributed open-source software application that runs on a peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain network 
rather than a single computer.

## **E**

## Execution nodes
[Execution](https://docs.onflow.org/nodes/node-operation/node-roles/#execution) nodes are the most resource-intensive nodes on the Flow network,
responsible for executing transactions and maintaining the Execution State ( a cryptographically-verifiable data store for all user accounts) 
and smart contract states ( as well as responding to queries related to it).

## Event
[Events](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/events/) are special values that can be emitted during the execution of a Cadence smart contract. Events can be used to log information.

## **F**

## Mainnet
Mainnet is the blockchain network representing the production. Blockchains have different networks (e.g. [testnet](https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/)) 
that can be used to develop and test before rolling out to the mainnet.

## Metadata
Metadata is used to describe data; in the case of an NFT, it describes NFT's essential properties, including its name, 
description, and anything else its creator feels is important. Flow has a FLIP that defines [metadata standards](https://docs.onflow.org/flip-fest-winners/).

## NFT Marketplace
An [NFT marketplace](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/tutorial/08-marketplace-compose/) is the platform where users will be able to buy and sell NFTs. 

## Mint
[Minting](https://docs.onflow.org/nft-marketplace/minting-nfts/) Minting is the creation of a new NFT or FT token recorded on the blockchain.
## **N**

## Nodes
Nodes are network stakeholders; their devices are authorized to keep track of the distributed ledger and serve as communication hubs 
for various network tasks. Also, nodes are mining new blocks, thus advancing the blockchain.

## Non-fungible token(NFT)
NFTs are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other.

## Nonce
A Nonce is an abbreviation for `number only used once,` which is a number added to a hashed—or encrypted—block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions.

## Non-Custodial model
The [non-custodial model](https://docs.onflow.org/nft-marketplace/#custodial-vs-non-custodial-model) for an NFT marketplace is where 
users control their assets and use their wallets to perform activities in the marketplace. These users hold the account keys.

## **P**

## Payer
A [payer](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-go-sdk/#transactions) is an account that is paying for the transaction fees.

## Payment Envelope
The outermost portion of the transaction, which contains the payload and envelope signatures, is the [payment envelope](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/transaction-signing/#payment-envelope).

## Payload
The transaction [payload](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/transaction-signing/#payload) is the innermost portion of a transaction and contains the data that uniquely identifies the operations applied by the transaction.

## Permissionless
A network is [permissionless](https://www.onflow.org/post/permissionless-smart-contract-deployment-flow-blockchain) if key actions can be completed without approval by a central entity. Key actions include running nodes, deploying and updating contracts, and much more. On Flow, 
everyone can deploy and update contracts to the mainnet without approval since the summer of 2022

## Public keys
A [public key](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/crypto/#publickey) allows you to receive cryptocurrency transactions. It's a cryptographic code that's paired with a private key. 


## Private keys
Private keys are used for both encrypting and decrypting sensitive data.

## Proving account ownership
[Proving ownership](https://docs.onflow.org/fcl/reference/proving-authentication/) of an on-chain account is a way to authenticate a user with an application backend. 

## Proposer
The proposer is an account that proposes a transaction. Sometimes, proposers differ from the account owner and from the transaction signer.

## **R**

## Resources
A [resource](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/resources/) is an ownable piece of data and functionality that can live in the user's account storage.

## Resources oriented programming
Resource-oriented programming is a new pattern that pairs linear types with object capabilities to create a secure and declarative model for digital ownership. Therefore, ensuring that resources (used to represent scarce digital assets) can only exist in one location at a time and cannot be copied, accidentally lost, or deleted.

## **S**

## Service account
The [service account](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts/service-account/) is the account that manages the core protocol requirements of Flow.

## Script
[Scripts](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-js-testing/execute-scripts/) let you run non-permanent Cadence scripts on the Flow blockchain. 

## Signature
Digital signatures are a fundamental building block in blockchains, used mainly to authenticate transactions. 
See [user signatures](https://docs.onflow.org/fcl/reference/user-signatures/#verifying-user-signatures).

## SDK
A software development toolkit (SDK) is a set of software tools and programs provided by hardware and software vendors that developers can use to build applications for specific platforms. 

## Smart contract
A [Smart Contracts](https://docs.onflow.org/dapp-development/smart-contracts/) is a collection of code, deployed to a permanent location on the blockchain, that defines the core logic for a dapp.

## Spork
A spork is a coordinated network upgrade process where node operators upgrade their node software and re-initialize with a 
consolidated representation of the previous spork's state. 

## **T**

## Transactions
[Transactions](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/transactions/) are objects signed by one or more accounts and sent to the chain to interact with them.

## Transactions fees
[Transaction fees](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-token/concepts/#segmented-transaction-fees) are applied only once per transaction at the time of execution.

## Testnet
A testnet is an instance of a blockchain powered by the same or a newer version of the underlying software to be used for testing and experimentation without risk to real funds or the main chain.

## **U**

## User signature
A user signature proves the authorization of transactions for an address without exposing its private key. 

## **V**

## Verification nodes
[Verification nodes](https://docs.onflow.org/nodes/node-operation/node-roles/#verification) are responsible for confirming the correctness of the work done by Execution nodes.

## VSCode Flow
Vscode Flow is an extension for the VSCode editor that integrates Cadence into [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.onflow.org/vscode-extension/). 
It provides syntax highlighting, type checking, code completion, etc.

## **W**

## Wallet discovery
[FCL's discovery](https://docs.onflow.org/fcl/reference/discovery/#wallet-discovery) mechanism relieves the burden of integrating with 
Flow compatible wallets and lets developers focus on building their dapp and providing their users as many options as possible.

## Wallet
[Flow Wallets](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-token/available-wallets/) are applications that give access to your Flow accounts, allow you to send and receive funds, and enable you to interact with Flow applications.

## zk-SNARK
The acronym zk-SNARK stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,” and refers to a proof construction where one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier.
