## Collection Nodes
### Introduction:

- Collection Nodes are bandwidth-optimized nodes divided by the protocol into several cooperating Clusters whose main responsibility is to manage the transaction pool and collect well-formed transactions to propose to Consensus Nodes. Incoming transactions get assigned to a Cluster pseudorandomly, and it is the Collection Nodes responsibility to sign the transactions and assemble them into Collections. After they have passed on these Collections to the Consensus Nodes, they will continue to store the transaction text until the Execution Nodes have finished processing it.

### Why you would choose to run a Collection Node:

- If you want to ensure your user's transactions are included ASAP and you want to ensure a reliable point of contact with the network then a Collection Node is for you! These nodes are a bit heavier as they contribute to performance but if you’re up for the work, we’d love to have you.

### Minimum Stake:

- 250,000 FLOW

### Rewards Structure:

- Rewards are paid out proportional to the stake each node operator contributes to its node group. Node groups are assigned rewards based on their revenue ratio which is a coefficient assigned to them based on the security they contribute to the network.
- All rewards will be paid out according to the following schedule:
    - Initial startup phase: no rewards
    - Bootstrapping phase: rewards of 20% annualized
    - After bootstrapping: rewards of 3.75% annually
- The reward payout on a per node basis is equal to:

```
R(n_node) = ((annualised reward)*(Tn))/(number of staked nodes in n)

```

- 'Tn' for each node reflects their portion of total stake. For Collection nodes, this includes the following
    - Collection Nodes comprise 16.8% of total stake (TL= 0.168)
- At network launch, there will be no more than:
    - 3 Execution Nodes
    - 43 Consensus Nodes
    - 29 Collection Nodes
    - 73 Verification Nodes (*100 when performance permits)
- These numbers were chosen to ensure consistent returns for running a single node of any type. Over time, the number of nodes will increase to promote participation but we don't anticipate increasing the number of participating nodes by more than double in the first year of the network's operation.

### Keys:

    - Staking Key: Your node uses its private staking key to sign every message it sends to the Flow network. The signature guarantees authenticity and integrity for each message. This allows the holding of each node accountable for protocol compliant behaviour (or lack thereof) with its financial stake. If your messages are malicious or badly formed, other nodes can raise a slashing witness against your node which might result in your stake being slashed by the consensus nodes, if your node violated the protocol. If your staking key is compromised, an attacker can impersonate your node and result in your stake being slashed. Staking keys are not tied to Flow Accounts, they can not own resources or authorize transactions in the execution environment. Block rewards and other funds do not get paid into the Staking Key's balance, nor can the Staking Key authorize withdrawal of stake during the first Epoch. Therefore Staking Keys can be said to control no funds and are not monetary targets.
    - Networking Key: Your networking key is much like your staking key in that it's an identifier of your node to the network. The Networking Key operates at a lower protocol level, and controls and authorizes your access to the [network communication layer](https://libp2p.io/). Messages of any type sent to the communication layer are signed with this key, including control messages and metadata messages. If your node sends malformed messages to the network, your networking key may be blocked by other nodes and your node will no longer be able to communicate with the rest of the network. If your Networking key is compromised, an attacker may use it to send messages to the network, creating a denial of service. If this happens and your key is blocked, you will lose access to the network, and a prolonged disconnect may lead to your stake being slashed.

## Consensus Nodes
### Introduction:

- Consensus Nodes form and propose blocks to create a globally consistent chain of blocks. The main job of the Consensus Nodes is to validate that the signed collection hashes submitted to them by Collection Nodes were, in fact, signed by the required majority of Collection Nodes. Simply put, the Consensus Nodes assemble the transactions into blocks and finalize them through voting. The more participants there are in this process, the more decentralized the network. For this reason, this group of nodes has minimal bandwidth and computation requirements, allowing even a modest computing device (any consumer-grade hardware) to participate in the voting process and ensure the safety of the network. By lowering the requirements to participate, Flow makes it extremely difficult and expensive to coordinate a Byzantine majority of consensus nodes. These nodes act as a checkpoint against Collection Nodes and are notably held accountable only by its fellow Consensus Nodes.

### Why you would choose to run a Consensus Node:

- Consensus nodes are the keepers or order and truth - they ensure the security of the network and are relatively lightweight to keep participation accessible to all. If you’re affiliated with a non-profit, university, digital rights group, or other group that is committed to the maintenance and good governance of decentralised networks then this is the node for you!

### Minimum Stake: 

- 500,000 FLOW

### Rewards Structure:

    - Random Beacon Key: This key is used as part of the Random Beacon distributed protocol for generating verifiable yet unpredictable randomness for every block. A majority of *more than 50%* of the Random Beacon keys must sign a block in order to reconstruct the block's source of randomness through a threshold signature algorithm. Manual management of this key is only needed for genesis. In the future, consensus nodes will automatically generate their random Random Beacon Keys in a joint, interactive protocol before the new Epoch starts.

## Execution Nodes
### Introduction:

- Execution Nodes are the most resource-intensive nodes on the Flow network, responsible for executing transactions and maintaining the Execution State (a cryptographically-verifiable data store for all user accounts and smart contract states), as well as responding to queries related to it. It is the job of the Execution Nodes to compute the outputs of the blocks they are provided. They then ask the Collection Nodes for the collections containing transactions that are to be executed. With this data they are able to compute the output, which is later verified by Verification Nodes to ensure honesty (allocation of Verification Nodes is via a sortition algorithm). The Execution Nodes are primarily responsible for Flow's improvements in scale and efficiency because only a very small number of these powerful computing resources are required to compute and store the historical state. While execution nodes give the Flow network its performance characteristics (highly scalable within a single shared state environment (i.e., no sharding)), they require significant hardware requirements and therefore make them the least accessible option for participation as a Validator. Because the revenue pool splits between relatively few nodes, the revenue per-node should more than compensate for the high capital costs of operating this node.

### Why you would choose to run an Execution Node:

- The muscle of the network - these folks have the resources to bring performance and significant economies of scale to the network. The hardware requirements are clearly understood and are very manageable for these actors. If you are capable of executing powerful computations and maintaining the entire historical state, then this may be the node for you as you will be compensated fairly for taking on such a large task!

## Verification Nodes
### Introduction:

- Verification Nodes are responsible for confirming the correctness of the work done by the Execution Nodes. While individual Verification Nodes only check a small amount of the total computation, collectively they check every computation many times in parallel. A sortition algorithm determines which chunks of data from the Execution Nodes the Verification Node must query to check that they were computed correctly. Ultimately, these nodes keep the Execution Nodes honest; and this balance of power maintains the access, security, and verifiability criteria of decentralization. It is highly byzantine fault-tolerant because even if there is a substantial number of byzantine errors in the Verification Node pool, the Consensus Nodes are still required to approve the transactions they signed were reviewed by a critical amount of the network.

### Why you would choose to run a Verification Node:

- The most accessible node type, designed to make checking the results of transactions (and keeping the Execution Nodes in check!) super easy. If you want to provide your dapp or your users with first-hand attestations to the execution state then a Verification Node is for you. This is also a good node to choose if you are somewhat newer to the node-operating world and are interested in getting involved.

### Minimum Stake:
