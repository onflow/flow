## Introduction



### Something else

FLOW is the default token for the Flow protocol, meaning it is used for all protocol-level fee payments, 
rewards and staking transactions. FLOW implements the standard [Flow Fungible Token interface](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft), 
which all other on-chain fungible tokens also conform to. This interface is defined in Cadence,
Flow's native smart-contract programming language, which makes it easy to write applications that
interact with FLOW.
