### Can anybody run a node? What is the approval process?

Individuals can go through an application process that involves asking about their background and experience contributing to decentralized projects. 

Pending approval, new node operators will be onboarded and invited to join a webinar to meet the team and share more about how theyâ€™ll grow the community. Node Operators are invited to join and partipate in Flow's Node Validator Discord channel for set up questions and network announcements.

In the long-term. anyone can become a Node Validator on Flow.

### How do I generate keys??

Please follow the instructions provided here: [Generate Your Node Keys](/operator/node-bootstrap#generating-your-node-id)

### How do I check on the status of my node?

Please follow the instructions provided here: [Monitoring nodes](/operator/monitoring-nodes)

### Can the node address (IP or hostname) be changed after a spork?

No. The node addresses are baked-in as part of the identity table stored on-chain and hence cannot be changed after a spork. It can be changed at the next spork.

### Can I bootstrap and run a node at anytime?

The node has to be included as part of the spork and only then will be part of the Flow protocol. Hence, a node can be bootstrapped only during a spork.
