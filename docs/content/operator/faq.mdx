### Can anybody run a node? What is the approval process?

For the first 6 months of the network, all participating nodes must present a case for how they will add unique value to the network.

Individuals go through an application process that includes a bit about their background and experience contributing to decentralized projects. 

They then join a webinar to meet the team and share more about how theyâ€™ll grow the community. The top 10 applicants, in terms of community impact, will be granted a spot to run a node.

Long-term anyone can become a Node Validator.

### How do I generate keys??

Please follow the instructions provided here: [Generate Your Node Keys](/operator/node-bootstrap#generating-your-node-id)

### How do I see the status of my node?

Please follow the instructions provided here: [Monitoring nodes](/operator/monitoring-nodes)

### Can the node address (IP or hostname) be changed after a spork?

No. The node addresses is baked-in as part of the identity table stored on-chain and hence cannot be changed after a spork. It can be changed at the next spork.

### Can I bootstrap and run a node at anytime?

The node has to be included as part of the spork and only then will be part of the Flow protocol. Hence, a node can be bootstrapped only during a spork.
