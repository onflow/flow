## The Road to Mainnet

The following sections cover the steps a developer should take to prepare their application for deployment on Flow Mainnet.

**1. [Smart Contract Testing](/dapp-development/contract-testing/)**

Smart contracts are the most important component of any dapp:
they often manage user assets, application state and other vital pieces of data.
As such, smart contracts should be rigorously tested.

**2. [Testnet Deployment](/dapp-development/testnet-deployment/)**

Testnet is the perfect proving ground for any new application.
Learn how to use the Flow toolchain to deploy your dapp to Testnet.

**3. [Testnet Testing](/dapp-development/testnet-testing/)**

Testnet is the closest you will get to the real thing.
In order to uncover bugs that may only appear on a real network,
you should thoroughly test your dapp on Testnet before considering a Mainnet release.

**4. [Mainnet Account Setup](/dapp-development/mainnet-account-setup/)**

As soon as you are ready for mainnet, you need to create and setup a mainnet account that you can use to deploy and manage your contracts.

**5. [Mainnet Deployment](/dapp-development/mainnet-deployment/)**

Learn about the steps you will need to take to promote your dapp from Testnet to Mainnet.
