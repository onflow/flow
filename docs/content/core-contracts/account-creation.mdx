description: Techniques for creating accounts on Flow
---

This document covers the transaction logic required to create accounts 
on the Flow blockchain. 
Read the [accounts & keys documentation](/concepts/accounts-and-keys) 
for an overview of the Flow account model.

## Batch Account Creation 

A single transaction can create multiple accounts by making 
multiple calls to the `AuthAccount` initializer.

<Callout type="warning">

Due to current transaction limits, 
accounts **should not be created in batches larger than 20 accounts**.
</Callout>

The examples below emit the same `flow.AccountCreated` event
as a normal account creation transaction. 
However, rather than emitting a single event, 
these transactions emit one event for each new account.

Check out this page to see how account creation transactions and events work in Go: 
[Create an Account with the Go SDK](/flow-go-sdk/create-account/).

### Unique Key For Each Account

```cadence
transaction(publicKeys: [String]) {
  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
    for publicKey in publicKeys {
      let account = AuthAccount(payer: signer)
      account.addPublicKey(publicKey.decodeHex())
    }
  }
}
```

### Same Key For All Accounts

```cadence
transaction(publicKey: String, count: Int) {
  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
    var i = 0
    while i < count {
      let account = AuthAccount(payer: signer)
      account.addPublicKey(publicKey.decodeHex())

      i = i + 1
    }
  }
}
```
