The service account is the account that manages the core protocol requirements of Flow.
There are two contracts deployed to the service account:

- `FlowServiceAccount` tracks transaction fees, deployment permissions, and provides 
some convenience methods for Flow Token operations.

- `FlowStorageFees` defines and implements the rules and methods for how accounts pay for their storage usage.
