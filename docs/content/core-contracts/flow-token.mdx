# Events

Flow relies on a set of core contracts that define key portions of the Flow protocol. Those contracts are core contracts 
and are made to emit the events documented below. You can read about the [core contracts here](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts) 
and view their source code and event definitions.

Events emitted from core contracts follow a standard format:

```
A.{contract address}.{contract name}.{event name}
```

The components of the format are:
- `contract address` - the address of the account the contract has been deployed to
- `contract name` - the name of the contract in the source code
- `event name` - the name of the event as declared in the source code

### Flow Token Contract
Description of events emitted from the [FLOW Token contract](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts/flow-token/). 
The contract defines the fungible FLOW token. Please note that events for the fungible token contracts are the same 
if deployed to a different account but the `contract address` is 
changed to the address of the account the contract has been deployed to.

### Tokens Initialized

Event that is emitted when the contract gets created.

- Event name: `TokensInitialized`
- Mainnet event: `A.1654653399040a61.FlowToken.TokensInitialized`
- Testnet event: `A.7e60df042a9c0868.FlowToken.TokensInitialized`

```cadence
pub event TokensInitialized(initialSupply: UFix64)
```

| Field             | Type   | Description                                                            |
