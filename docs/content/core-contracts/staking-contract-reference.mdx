## Node Staker Transactions

Please see the [Locked Tokens contract](/core-contracts/locked-tokens/#transactions) for information about staking with locked tokens.
Documentation for staking with unlocked tokens will be updated when unlocked tokens are available to stake with.

## Delegator Transactions

Please see the [Locked Tokens contract](/core-contracts/locked-tokens/#transactions) for information about delegating with locked tokens.
Documentation for delegating with unlocked tokens will be updated when unlocked tokens are available to delegate with.

# Events

The `FlowIDTableStaking` contract emits an event whenever an important action occurs.
See the [staking events Documentation](/staking/events) for more information about each event.

    pub event NewEpoch(totalStaked: UFix64, totalRewardPayout: UFix64)
