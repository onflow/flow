# Contract

The `FlowEpoch` contract is the state machine that manages Epoch phases and emits service events.
The `FlowClusterQC` and `FlowDKG` contracts manage the processes that happen during the Epoch Setup phase.

These contracts are all deployed to the same account as the `FlowIDTableStaking` contract.
