## Accessing Flow Devnet

Currently, there is an internal Devnet, available for access:

- [access-001.devnet15.nodes.onflow.org:9000](http://access-001.devnet15.nodes.onflow.org:9000/)

For example, to access the network using the [Flow Go SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk):

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"

func main() {
  flowAccessAddress := "access-001.devnet15.nodes.onflow.org:9000"
  flowClient, _ := client.New(flowAccessAddress, grpc.WithInsecure())

  // ...
}

```

## Account Creation and Token Funding Requests

Accounts and Tokens for testing are available by request through the [Flow Faucet](https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/) 

- For account creation requests please generate ECDSA_P256 key pair and provide the public key along with your contact information then submit the form.
    - If there were no errors with your request then an email will be sent with the address of newly created account. All accounts are created with 1000 FLOW to start.
- For token funding request please provide the address you would like to have the Flow tokens sent to along with your contact information.
    - If there were no errors with your request then an email will be sent to confirm that 1000 FLOW has been added to your account.
- An error email will be sent to you should there be any issues processing your request

## Key Generation

- Key Generation, using our `flow-go-sdk` (crypto package):

    ```go
    import (
      "crypto/rand"
    	"fmt"

      "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/crypto"
    )

    func main() {

    	// This seed must be kept safe if you want to use it to regenerate your private key
    	seed := make([]byte, crypto.MinSeedLength)

    	_, err := rand.Read(seed)
    	if err != nil {
    		panic(err)
    	}

    	// Remember to save your private key somewhere safe
    	privateKey, err := crypto.GeneratePrivateKey(crypto.ECDSA_P256, seed)
    	if err != nil {
    		panic(err)
    	}
    	// This will be your public key, and what you need to send to us
    	fmt.Printf("%x", privateKey.PublicKey().Encode())
    }

    ```

## Devnet Account Usage

Once you receive your account, you'll be able make use of that account using our SDK. Some examples are available here in the SDK repo:

- [https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples)

Some of these examples

- `create_account`
- `deploy_contract`

Transactions will now require [fees](https://www.notion.so/token/concepts/) in order to complete.

## Important Devnet Smart Contract Addresses

In order to access some of the contracts deployed to Flow Devnet, you can import them by using the following import addresses:

```cadence
import FungibleToken from 0x9a0766d93b6608b7
import FlowToken from 0x7e60df042a9c0868
import NonFungibleToken from 0x631e88ae7f1d7c20

```
