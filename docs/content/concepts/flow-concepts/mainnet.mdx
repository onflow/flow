## Accessing Flow Mainnet

Currently, there is an internal Mainnet, available for access:

- [access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000](http://access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000/)

For example, to access the network using the [Flow Go SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk):

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"

func main() {
  flowAccessAddress := "access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000"
  flowClient, _ := client.New(flowAccessAddress, grpc.WithInsecure())

  // ...
}

```
