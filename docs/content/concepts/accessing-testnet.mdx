## Accessing Flow Testnet

Currently, there is an internal Testnet, available for access:

- [access.testnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000](http://access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000/)

For example, to access the network using the [Flow Go SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk):

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"

func main() {
  flowAccessAddress := "access.testnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000"
  flowClient, _ := client.New(flowAccessAddress, grpc.WithInsecure())
  // ...
}
```

## Account Creation and Token Funding Requests

Accounts and Tokens for testing are available by request through the [Flow Faucet](https://testnet-faucet-v2.onflow.org/)

### Generate a Key Pair for the Faucet

For Testnet, it's easy to generate a new key pair with the [Flow CLI](https://github.com/onflow/flow-cli):

```sh
flow keys generate
```

By default, this command generates an ECDSA key pair on the P-256 curve.

**Note: this tool is intended for development purposes only and is not recommended for production use.**

## Testnet Account Usage

Once you receive your account, you'll be able make use of that account using our SDK. Some examples are available here in the SDK repo:

- [https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/tree/master/examples)

Some of these examples

- `create_account`
- `deploy_contract`

Transactions will now require fees in order to complete.

## Important Testnet Smart Contract Addresses

In order to access some of the contracts deployed to Flow Testnet, you can import them by using the following import addresses:

```cadence
import FungibleToken from 0x9a0766d93b6608b7
import FlowToken from 0x7e60df042a9c0868
import NonFungibleToken from 0x631e88ae7f1d7c20
```
