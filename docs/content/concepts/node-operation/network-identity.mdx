title: Node's Network Identity
---

Conceptually, it is important to distinguish between a node participating in the network and the account address for managing funds related to the node's operation:

### The Protocol State

The state of a staked Flow node with its operational keys from the perspective of the protocol.

- For each staked node in the network, the protocol state contains a node identity (discussed in detail below). Among other information, the node identity lists all public operational keys. 
As explained in the [Node Operation Concepts](doc:node-keys), operational keys enforce authenticity and integrity of the nodes' protocol messages. A node's **operational keys do _not_ grant access to any funds**.
- The private operational keys for a node are managed by the node operator.

### The Execution State

The state which holds conventional user accounts, including the address for managing funds related to the nodes' operations (such as [staking and earning rewards](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/staking-rewards)).

From a protocol perspective, there is no direct coupling needed between the Protocol State and the Execution State. The execution state is managed by the Execution Nodes, while the Protocol State is governed directly by the consensus nodes.

Each node in the network has a _Node Identity_. A table with the identities of all legitimate nodes is maintained by the consensus committee as part of the _Protocol State_. 
Updates to this Protocol State are published by consensus nodes as part of their blocks.

From the perspective of the Flow protocol, the _Identity_ of a node includes:

- Node ID
- Networking Address
- [Public Staking, Networking, and (optional) Random Beacon key](doc:node-keys)
- Current stake balance

As a node operator, you need to create a node Identity for your node. To generate, you need to hash your staking public key.

The Protocol State also maps to a User Account Address for each node to ensure the automatic distribution of rewards to the account holder.

- Creating the Network Identity for your node will be happen during bootstrapping based on the public key and supplemental information you provide (see [Genesis Bootstrapping](https://dash.readme.io/project/onflow/v0.3/docs/genesis-bootstrapping) for details)
