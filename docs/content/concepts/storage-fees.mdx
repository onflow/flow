title: Storing Data on Flow
---

## **Overview**

Each Flow account has an associated storage used. The account's storage used is the byte size of all of the data stored in the account's storage. Accounts also have a storage capacity, which is directly tied to the amount of Flow tokens an account has. The account can, without any additional cost, use any amount of storage up to its storage capacity. **If a transaction would put an account over storage capacity, that transaction fails and is reverted. Likewise, if a transaction would drop an account's balance below 0.1 Flow tokens, which is the minimum an account can have, the transaction would also fail.**

## Storage Capacity

Storage capacity of an account is dictated by the amount of FLOW tokens it has. **The minimum amount of FLOW tokens an account can have is 0.1. This minimum is provided by the account creator at account creation.** The minimum account reservation ensures that most accounts won't run out of storage capacity if anyone deposits anything (like an NFT) to the account.

The exact amount of storage capacity an account has is the amount of FLOW tokens the account has times the `storageBytesPerReservedFlow` variable defined on the `StorageFees` smart contract, which is 1 MiB per 1 reserved FLOW token.

Any account can increase the storage capacity of an account by depositing more FLOW tokens to the account.

## Storage Used

All data that is in an account's storage counts towards storage used. Even when an account is newly created it is not empty. There are already some items in its storage:

- Metadata that marks that the account exists.
- An empty FLOW token vault, and stored receiver capability.
- Public keys to the account if the account was created with keys.
- Smart contracts deployed on the account if the account was created with contracts.
- The value of the account’s storage used as an unsigned integer.

Adding additional keys, smart contracts, capabilities, resources, etc. to the account counts towards storage used.

Data stored on the Flow blockchain is stored in a key-value ledger. Each item’s key contains the address that owns the item and the path to the item. Just as the shipping cost of a box of things you send to a friend includes the weight of the carton box itself, storing items on flow takes into account the key it is stored with. This means that the storage used by each item is the byte length of the item plus the byte length of the item’s key.

## Storage Parameters

Two parameters define storage limits:

- Minimum account FLOW is **0.1 Flow tokens** and represents **100 KiB** of storage capacity. This is also the amount of Flow tokens that the creator of a new account needs to provide for the account's storage reservation. (`StorageFees.minimumStorageReservation`)
- The amount of storage capacity one Flow token represents is **1 MiB per Flow token**. (`StorageFees.storageBytesPerReservedFlow`)

## FAQ

### **Why is there an account minimum balance?**

The more data that is stored on Flow, the higher the storage requirements for execution nodes that need to store the data. As the size of the data grows, it's more and more difficult and costly for the execution nodes to meet those requirements.
Storage fees were put in place to regulate the growth of data stored on the Flow blockchain.

### **What is my current storage usage?**

The values of storage used and storage capacity are available as fields both on `AuthAccount` and `PublicAccount` Cadence types.

```cadence
pub fun main(address: Address) {
    let account = getAccount(address)
    log(account.storageUsed)
    log(account.storageCapacity)
}
```
