There's a lot to cover when we're talking about a system like Flow, the technology behind the network
and the design of systems you'll use to interact with it. This section will help you uncover information that can help you better understand
Flow's moving parts.

## Technical Background

- The Flow [Technical Primer](https://www.onflow.org/primer) is a great place to start to understand how Flow works. 
- The Flow team has published 3 [technical whitepapers](https://www.onflow.org/technical-paper) covering in-depth the unique innovation behind the Flow blockchain network.

## Tokenomics

- To understand more about Flow's Token Economics, and the **FLOW token**, you can read the [Flow Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics) guide.
- FLOW tokens are Flow's native Fungible Token. To learn more about how to work with them in your applications, go [here](/flow-token)
