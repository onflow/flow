description: How to get started running a node on Flow
---

This guide is for getting a new node staked and running on Flow other than a permissionless Access node. For running a permissionless Access node see [Access node setup](access-node-setup.mdx). For sporking documentation for existing node operators, see [Spork Process](/nodes/node-operation/spork).

## Timing

New nodes are able to join the network each time a new epoch begins.
In order to join the network at epoch N+1, the node must be registered with sufficient stake and
authorized by the service account prior to the end of epoch N's Staking Auction Phase.
Confirmation of a new node's inclusion in epoch N+1 is included in the [`EpochSetup` event](/staking/epoch-scripts-events/#epochsetup).

Nodes registered for epoch N+1 are able to participate in network communication on a limited basis starting in the `Epoch Setup Phase` of epoch N.

![Flow Epoch Schedule](https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-resources/documentation-assets/epoch-startup-order.png)

Once registered and confirmed to join the network at epoch N+1, the node must start up **before** epoch N+1 begins.
* Verification & Access nodes may start up any time during the `Epoch Setup Phase`.
* Consensus & Collection nodes must start up within the first **1000 views (~30mins)**
of the `Epoch Setup Phase` to participate in the [Epoch Preparation Protocol](/staking/epoch-preparation/#phase-1-epoch-setup).

<Callout type="info">

For `consensus` and `collection` node types an additional key will be created for the Machine Account.
For all other node types this will not be needed.

</Callout>

#### Machine Account Creation

If you are running a collection and consensus node, you will have an additional private key file (`node-machine-account-key.priv.json`)
which contains the private key for your node's machine account. You can learn more about machine
accounts [here](/staking/machine-account/).

In Step 2 of this guide, when you submit a transaction to stake your node, you will need to provide the
machine account public key, which can be found in the output of the previous `bootstrap key` command.

```shell:title=MachineAccountPublicKey
$./boot-tools/bootstrap key --address ${YOUR_NODE_ADDRESS} --role ${YOUR_NODE_ROLE}  -o ./bootstrap
...
<nil> DBG encoded public machine account key machineAccountPubKey=1b9c00e6f0930792c5738d3397169f8a592416f334cf11e84e6327b98691f2b72158b40886a4c3663696f96cd15bfb5a08730e529f62a00c78e2405013a6016d

```

<Callout type="warning">

Copy the machine account public key somewhere safe. You will need it in a later step.

</Callout>

## Step 2 - Stake Your Node

Stake your node via [Flow Port](https://port.onflow.org/)

The `node details` (`Node ID`, `Network Address`, `Networking Key` and `Staking Key`) that need to be submitted when staking the node on Flow Port, can be found in the file: `./bootstrap/public-root-information/node-info.pub.<node-id>.json`.

```shell:title=Example
$cat ./bootstrap/public-root-information/node-info.pub.39fa54984b8eaa463e129919464f61c8cec3a4389478df79c44eb9bfbf30799a.json
{
  "Role": "consensus",
  "Address": "consensus-001.nodes.flow.com:3569",
  "NodeID": "39fa54984b8eaa463e129919464f61c8cec3a4389478df79c44eb9bfbf30799a",
  "Weight": 1000,
  "NetworkPubKey": "d92e3d5880abe233cf9fe9104db34bbb31251468a541454722b3870c04156a1b0504aef443bcaad124b997384b8fe7052847ce1e6189af1392d865e6be69835b",
  "StakingPubKey": "917826e018f056a00b778a58ae83054906957ffd4b6f1b7da083551f7a9f35e02b76ace50424ed7d2c9fc69207a59f0f08a031048f5641db94e77d0648b24d150dedd54bab7cd44b4aa60cfd54be418647b0b3965f8ae54c0bcb48ae9d705162"
}
```

If you are running a collection or consensus node, you will need to provide an additional field `Machine Account Public Key`.
This value is found in the output of the `bootstrap key` command from Step 1.

<Callout type="info">

Please let us know your node id via discord or email.

</Callout>

### Finalize Machine Account Setup

<Callout type="warning">

If you are not running a collection or consensus node, you can skip this step.

</Callout>

You will now need to use the `bootstrap` utility to run `machine-account` with the created address to finalize the set up of your Machine account.

```shell
$ ./boot-tools/bootstrap machine-account --address ${YOUR_MACHINE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS} -o ./bootstrap
```

```shell:title=Example
$ ./boot-tools/bootstrap machine-account --address 0x1de23de44985c7e7 -o ./bootstrap
<nil> INF read machine account private key json
<nil> DBG encoded public machine account key machineAccountPubKey=2743786d1ff1bf7d7026d693a774210eaa54728343859baab62e2df7f71a370651f4c7fd239d07af170e484eedd4f3c2df47103f6c39baf2eb2a50f67bbcba6a

$tree ./bootstrap/
./bootstrap
├── private-root-information
│   └── private-node-info_d60bd55ee616c5c297cae1d5cfb7f65e7e04014d9c4abe595af2fd83f3cfe160

3 directories, 5 files
```

After running this step, you should see the `node-machine-account-info.priv.json` file in your `bootstrap` directory as shown above.

### Verify Machine Account Setup

After finalizing your machine account setup, you should verify its correctness with the `check-machine-account` command:

```shell:title=CheckMachineAccount
$ ./boot-tools/bootstrap check-machine-account --access-address access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000 -o ./bootstrap
<nil> DBG read machine account info from disk hash_algo=SHA3_256 key_index=0 machine_account_address=0x284463aa6e25877c machine_account_pub_key=f847b84051bad4512101640772bf5e05e8a49868d92eaf9ebed41030881d95485769afd28653c5c53216cdcda4554384bb3ff6396a2ac04842422d55f0562496ad8d952802038203e8 signing_algo=ECDSA_P256
<nil> DBG checking machine account configuration... machine_account_address=0x284463aa6e25877c role=consensus
<nil> DBG machine account balance: 0.10000000
<nil> INF 🤖 machine account is configured correctly
```

This command will detect and provide information about common misconfigurations, or confirm that the machine account is configured correctly.

### Push transit keys (consensus node only)

If you are running a consensus node, run the following command to push the transit keys. Use the token `mainnet-x-organization` e.g. `mainnet-17-companyname`.

```shell:title=transit
$ ./boot-tools/transit push-transit-key -b ./bootstrap -t mainnet-x-organization
<nil> INF generating transit keys
<nil> INF generating key pair
<nil> INF attempting to push transit public key to the transit servers
<nil> INF successfully pushed transit public key to the transit servers
```

## Step 3 - Start Your Flow Node

Ensure you have configured your node using the [Node Setup guide](/nodes/node-operation/node-setup).

### Confirming authorization

You can confirm your node's successful registration and authorization by executing a Cadence script to query the [Staking Contract](/core-contracts/staking-contract-reference#contract).
At the end of the `Staking Auction Phase`, the members of the Proposed Identity Table are confirmed as authorized participants in the next epoch.
Therefore, if your node ID appears in the Proposed Identity Table during the `Staking Auction Phase`, your node will be a participant in the next epoch.

You can read the current Proposed Identity Table using the [getProposedTable script](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/transactions/idTableStaking/scripts/get_proposed_table.cdc).

You can read the current epoch phase using the [getEpochPhase script](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/transactions/epoch/scripts/get_epoch_phase.cdc). (A return value of `0` indicates the `Staking Auction Phase`.)

### Trusted Root Snapshot

Once your node has been registered and authorized by the service account, it will be able to participate in the next epoch.

![Flow Epoch Schedule](https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-resources/documentation-assets/epoch-startup-order.png)

A new node must bootstrap with a trusted root snapshot of the protocol state, where the node is a confirmed participant.
Since new nodes are confirmed at the end of the `Staking Auction Phase`, this means that, if the node is registered to join at epoch `N+1`, it must use a root snapshot from within the `Epoch Setup Phase` of epoch `N`.

### Dynamic Startup

Flow provides a mechanism called Dynamic Startup to simplify the process of obtaining the root snapshot.
When using Dynamic Startup, the node can be started **at any time during the `Staking Auction Phase`**.
The node will wait for the `Epoch Setup Phase` to begin, retrieve a valid root snapshot from a trusted Access Node, then bootstrap its state and join the network.
This is the recommended way to start your node for the first time.

1. Remove any `root-protocol-state-snapshot.json` file from your `bootstrap` folder. (If this file is present the node will attempt to bootstrap with it rather than Dynamic Startup.)
2. Select a trusted Access Node to provide the root snapshot. You will need this node's **secure GRPC server address** and **Networking Public Key**.
3. Configure Dynamic Startup by adding flags:
```shell:title=ExampleDynamicStartupFlags
  ... \
  --dynamic-startup-access-address=secure.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9001 \
  --dynamic-startup-access-publickey=28a0d9edd0de3f15866dfe4aea1560c4504fe313fc6ca3f63a63e4f98d0e295144692a58ebe7f7894349198613f65b2d960abf99ec2625e247b1c78ba5bf2eae
```
4. Start your node (see [guide](/nodes/node-operation/node-setup/#start-the-node))

<Callout type="info">
Once the node has bootstrapped, these flags may be removed.
</Callout>

### Manually Provisioned Root Snapshot

You can also provision the root snapshot file manually, then start the node without configuring Dynamic Startup.
A snapshot can be obtained from any Access Node using [Flow CLI](/flow-cli/).
```shell:title=RetrieveRootSnapshot
flow snapshot save /path/to/root/snapshot --network mainnet
```

<Callout type="warning">

The snapshot must be within the `Epoch Setup Phase`.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">

Since Collection and Consensus Nodes must start up in the first ~30mins of the `Epoch Setup Phase` (see [Timing](/nodes/node-operation/node-bootstrap/#timing)),
the snapshot must be provisioned within this time window.

</Callout>

Once a valid root snapshot file is downloaded to the node's bootstrap folder, it can be started (see [guide](/nodes/node-operation/node-setup/#start-the-node))
