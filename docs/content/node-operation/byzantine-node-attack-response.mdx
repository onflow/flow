description: How to respond to a byzantine node attack on the network
---

Flow, like any blockchain, forms an open decentralized peer-to-peer network between all the nodes of the network.
Hence, there exists an attack vector where one (or more than one) of the nodes is malicious (in other words byzantine) and intentionally tries to harm the network.
There exist several protections within the node software to deal with invalid messages - checking message signatures, checking message payload etc. are just some of them.
These protections guard the network against attacks. However, there could still be a byzantine node that spams the other nodes in the network with invalid data at volumes that are intended to impact node performance.
While this will not compromise the security of the network it could impact network liveness.

This guide explains how to detect such a node and what actions you should take a node operator to deal with such byzantine nodes.

## Detection

TODO

## Action

The response to an attack from a byzantine node is a three-pronged response.
It entails first and foremost, blocking traffic coming from the byzantine node to your node.
Then, raising a governance FLIP to remove the node from the network as described in this [FLIP](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/governance/20230105-identify-errant-node.md).
And finally, a service account transaction to set the node weight to 0.
This guide focuses mainly on the first action.
