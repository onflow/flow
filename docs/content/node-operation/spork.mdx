## What is a Spork?

In the mature Flow, new nodes can be staked and un-staked as the protocol advances from epoch to epoch. However, we are not there yet.
Hence, currently every couple of weeks we turn-off the network, update the identity list to include (and exclude) nodes and then turn the network back on again.
We call this process a **Spork**.

Also, as Flow evolves, we are continuously adding new features and discovering and fixing bugs in the Flow node software.
We also utilize a Spork as an opportunity to update the nodes with the latest releases.

## How frequently do we Spork?

The Flow network sporks approximately once per month. Upcoming sporks are announced in advance on the `#flow-validators-announcements` **Discord** channel.
