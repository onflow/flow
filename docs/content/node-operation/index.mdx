The Flow nodes are the vital component that supports the network and enables you to participate in the Flow blockchain.
A blockchain network is a collection of interconnected nodes working together to validate transactions and blocks using consensus a algorithm.
Therefore, you are contributing to the network as a node operator by running the Flow nodes.

## What are nodes
Blockchain nodes are network contributors, and as such, their device is authorized 
to maintain the distributed ledger and act as 
a central point of contact for a variety of network operations.

## Functions of Flow nodes
Flow has [four nodes](https://docs.onflow.org/node-operation/node-roles/) that fulfill a specific role in the operation of the network.
- **Collection:** manages the transaction pool and collects well-formed transactions to propose to Consensus nodes.
- **Consensus:** form and propose blocks like traditionally-structured proof-of-stake blockchains, using the HotStuff consensus algorithm to create a globally consistent chain of blocks.
- **Execution:** are Flow network's most resource-intensive nodes, responsible for executing transactions, maintaining the Execution State, and responding to related queries. 
- **Verification:** are responsible for confirming the correctness of the work done by Execution nodes.
- **Access:** routes transactions to the correct Collection node and routes state queries to available nodes. 

## Node operator
A node operator runs software that broadcasts transactions across the network and maintains a complete copy of the blockchain. The operation of blockchains requires nodes.
An operator ensures that nodes have enough resources to run smoothly and efficiently. Therefore, nodes require sufficient RAM, disk space, and bandwidth to function and support the network.

## Who can run a node?

Any individual or organization should be able to run one or more [nodes](https://docs.onflow.org/node-operation/faq/). Currently, however as the Flow protocol matures, 
anyone interested in running a node must present a case for how they will add unique value to the network. 

## Flow Port 
The [Flow Port](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-port/staking-guide/) is your portal to the decentralized world of Flow. It gives you access to your Flow account, interacts with the blockchain,
and manages your assets. Also, it is used to stake your FLOW tokens and start earning rewards. So, to run your nodes, you can stake them 
on the Flow port, and Flow Port only supports staking or delegating using tokens held in Blocto or Ledger wallets.

## Flow Staking
[Staking](https://developers.onflow.org/nodes/staking) is the act of depositing your Flow tokens as a nodes operator, and you'll be 
responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain.
This will keep Flow secure for everyone, and you earn your rewards in new Flow tokens. 
Running a Flow node and staking FLOW tokens through the node is one way to participate in the network, and the node is called a staked node.
The node could be any one of the four types in Flow: `Collection`, `Consensus`, `Execution`, or `Verification`. Such a staked node participates 
in the Flow protocol by performing its function based on its type, and the network periodically rewards the node for its contribution. 
However, the network could also punish the node by taking away some of the staked tokens if it violates certain rules.
