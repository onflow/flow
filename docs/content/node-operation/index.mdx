To run a node in the Flow network, the node must:
* be registered with sufficient stake
* be authorized by the service account

Before proceeding, ensure you have the stake required for your new node and that your node will be authorized by the service account (apply [here](https://www.onflow.org/node-validators)).

To set up a new Flow node you will need to complete the following steps:

1. [Provision](/node-operation/node-setup) the machine on which your node will run.

2. [Generate and register](/node-operation/node-bootstrap) your node identity.

3. [Start](/node-operation/node-bootstrap#step-2---getting-ready-to-start-your-flow-node) your node!
