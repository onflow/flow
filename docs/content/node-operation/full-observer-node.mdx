A full observer node is an unstaked access node that follows the flow consensus and serves the Access API using local data. This allows anyone
to setup an access node for local queries without the need for staking.

## Running a node

The full observer node was built in collaboration with the `optakt` team. The primary way to run a full observer node is with the Flow Data Provisioning Service (DPS).

### Data Provisioning Service

The [Data Provisioning Service](https://github.com/optakt/flow-dps/) provides efficient access to the full history of flow blockchain data from a single
API. DPS was built by the `optakt` team and greatly streamlines usecases that require archival data.

For more information on DPS and the rational behind it, see their [documentation](https://github.com/optakt/flow-dps/blob/master/docs/introduction.md)

The full observer node functionality is provided by the [DPS Live](https://github.com/optakt/flow-dps/tree/master/cmd/flow-dps-live) component, which
comsumes live state updates from the flow network.

### Custom Implementations

If you're looking to build a stand-alone observer node or integrate one into another system, the following example implementation will get you
started: https://github.com/onflow/full-observer-node-example
