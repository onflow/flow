description: Running an observer node locally
---

An observer node is similar to an access node and provides a locally accessible, continuously updated and verified copy of the block data. It serves the Access gRPC API but, unlike an access node, an observer node does not need to be staked and **anyone** can run it without being added to the approved list of nodes.

The observer node bootstraps by connecting to an access node and becoming part of the public network comprised of access nodes and other observer nodes. It then continuously receives blocks that are being added to the chain either directly from the access node or from other observer nodes that are part of the public network.
However, it makes no trust assumption of the upstream access node or the observer node which is providing the block and locally verifies that the blocks that are received are the correct extension of the chain e.g After receiving valid blocks A, B and C when it receives block D, it verifies that block D is indeed signed by the consensus nodes and is a valid next block. The block data that is received is indexed and made available via the Access gRPC API. For Collection, Transactions and Account queries, it delegates those requests to the upstream access node. Similarly, transactions and scripts sent to an observer node are also forwarded to the upstream access node. Future versions of the observer node will be able to serve this data locally as well.

Since the observer node is not staked, it does not produce or execute blocks but instead serves as an _unstaked access node_ that can be easily run on any consumer-grade computer which has enough disk space.

## Who should run an observer Node?

The observer node provides an alternative to running an access node. Hence, it is ideal for Dapps that need access to the latest block data available locally e.g a wallet application that needs to track the latest block ID and height. In addition to that, access node operators who want to scale their access nodes endpoints geographically can spin up geographically dispersed observer nodes which can talk to their staked access node and to each other.

## Running an observer node

### Hardware

In general, any consumer-grade computer with a decent network connection and sufficient disk space should be able to run an observer node.

Minimum requirements

- CPU with 2+ cores
- 4 GB RAM minimum
- 300 GB SSD disk
- 10Mbps network connection

### Steps to run an observer node

### Step 1 Generate the node directory structure
The observer node requires the following directory structure,
```
$ tree flow_observer/
flow_observer/
├── bootstrap
│         ├── network.key (file containing the node private network key)
│         └── public-root-information
│             └── root-protocol-state-snapshot.json (the genesis data of the current spork)
└── data (directory used by the observer node to store block data)
```

Create the parent and the sub-directories
e.g.
```
mkdir flow_observer
mkdir flow_observer/bootstrap
mkdir flow_observer/bootstrap/public-root-information
mkdir flow_observer/data
```

### Step 2 Generate the network key

Like any other Flow node, the observer also needs a networking ECDSA key to talk to the network.
The [Flow cli](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/install) can be used to generate this key.

e.g.
```
flow keys generate
Private Key  1fc3d962ec947bcc9d8dfae6b1e2b54dbdd208bbca0c7af094d5d52c7991257f
Public Key   774e3812f031d57f767a0afa79bd2cfad8a99b3d20b039f6583f82a5dbc5a208be70aa616ddfa1c7676ccac0b4e4e7da78ebdac6ab0d47cbae1efec95f66a7a5
```

Store the private key in a file under the bootstrap subdirectory
e.g.
```
$ cat flow_observer/bootstrap/network.key
1fc3d962ec947bcc9d8dfae6b1e2b54dbdd208bbca0c7af094d5d52c7991257f
```

### Step 3 Download the root-protocol-state-snapshot.json file for the current spork

The `root-protocol-state-snapshot.json` is generated for each [spork](https://developers.flow.com/nodes/node-operation/spork) and contains the genesis data for that spork.
It is published and made available after each spork. The download location is specified [here](https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/sporks.json) under [rootProtocolStateSnapshot](https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/sporks.json#L16) and can be downloaded as follows,

For mainnet-18
```
wget -P bootstrap/public-root-information https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-genesis-bootstrap/mainnet-18-execution/public-root-information/root-protocol-state-snapshot.json
wget -P bootstrap/public-root-information https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-genesis-bootstrap/mainnet-18-execution/public-root-information/root-protocol-state-snapshot.json.asc
```

For testnet-37
```
wget -P bootstrap/public-root-information https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-genesis-bootstrap/testnet-37/public-root-information/root-protocol-state-snapshot.json
wget -P bootstrap/public-root-information https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-genesis-bootstrap/testnet-37/public-root-information/root-protocol-state-snapshot.json.asc
```

#### Verify the PGP signature

Add the `flow-signer@onflow.org` public key
```
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --search-keys flow-signer@onflow.org
```

Verify the root-snapshot file
```
gpg --verify bootstrap/public-root-information/root-protocol-state-snapshot.json.asc
```

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'bootstrap/public-root-information/root-protocol-state-snapshot.json'
gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 15 11:34:33 2021 PDT
gpg:                using ECDSA key 40CD95717AC463E61EE3B285B718CA310EDB542F
gpg: Good signature from "Flow Team (Flow Full Observer node snapshot verification master key) <flow-signer@onflow.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 7D23 8D1A E6D3 2A71 8ECD  8611 CB52 64F7 FD4C DD27
     Subkey fingerprint: 40CD 9571 7AC4 63E6 1EE3  B285 B718 CA31 0EDB 542F
```

Alternately, if you don't care about the blocks before the current block, you can request the current root-snapshot file via the flow-cli.

For mainnet
```
flow snapshot save ./bootstrap/public-root-information/root-protocol-state-snapshot.json --network mainnet
```

For testnet
```
flow snapshot save ./bootstrap/public-root-information/root-protocol-state-snapshot.json --network testnet
```

### Step 4 Start the node

The observer node can be run as a docker container

#### Observer for Flow Mainnet

```
docker run --rm \
 -v /var/flow/bootstrap:/bootstrap:ro  \

 --observer-networking-key-path=/bootstrap/network.key
```

#### Observer for Flow Testnet

```
docker run --rm \

 --observer-networking-key-path=/bootstrap/network.key
```

_if running on a mac, replace `--network host` with `-p 9000:9000`_

The observer node acts as a DHT client and bootstraps from upstream access nodes which run the DHT server.
The upstream bootstrap server is specified using the `bootstrap-node-addresses` which is the comma separated list of hostnames of the access nodes.
The `bootstrap-node-public-keys` are the corresponding networking public key of those nodes.

The observer node delegates many of the API calls to the upstream access nodes.
The `upstream-node-addresses` is the list of access node hostnames to which this observer node can delegate to. The list can be different from the boostrap node list.
The `bootstrap-node-public-key` are the corresponding networking public key of those nodes.

_In the above docker commands, the Flow community access nodes are being used as the upstream access nodes.
However, any other Flow access node that supports an observer node can be used_

#### Flow community access nodes that support connections from observer nodes

Note: while the public keys remain the same, the hostnames change each spork to include the spork name. Substitute `[devnet_spork]` and `[mainnet_spork]` with the appropriate spork name (e.g. `mainnet14`). See [Past Sporks](https://docs.onflow.org/node-operation/past-sporks/) for the current spork for each network.

##### For mainnet

Access-007:
* Host: `access-007.[mainnet_spork].nodes.onflow.org`

_By default, the Observer node will serve the gRPC API on port 9000. To change this port use the parameter, `--rpc-addr` e.g. `--rpc-addr 9005`
Other parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/82da35141ff095fbf75ce2c950efec240ad38565/cmd/access/node_builder/access_node_builder.go#L523)_



:rocket: The node should now be up and running

You can use the [flow cli](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli), to query the node for blocks, transaction etc. similar to how you would query an access node.

e.g.
```
flow blocks get latest --host localhost:9000
```
