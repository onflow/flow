A full observer node is an unstaked access node that follows the flow consensus and serves the Access API using local data. SendTransaction and script execution requests are forwarded to an upstream staked access node. This allows anyone to setup an access node for local queries without the need for staking.

The node does the following:
* Maintains state by following a staked access node
* Verifies and stores blocks received from its upstream staked access node
* Serves the Access API
    * Get requests are processed using the node's local state
    * SendTransaction and script executions are forwarded to the configured staked access node
* Participates in the LibP2P network for unstaked nodes

The node does not:
* Sync the full blockchain history. For archival functionality, see [DLP](#data-provisioning-service).
* Participate in the staked flow network.

## Data Provisioning Service:

The [Data Provisioning Service](https://github.com/optakt/flow-dps/) provides access all flow blockchain data, current and historical, from a single API.

The full observer node functionality is provided by the [DPS Live](https://github.com/optakt/flow-dps/tree/master/cmd/flow-dps-live) application.

## Custom Implementations:

If you're looking to build a stand-alone observer node or integrate one into another system, the following example implementation will get you started: https://github.com/onflow/full-observer-node-example
