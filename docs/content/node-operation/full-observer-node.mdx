A full observer node is an unstaked access node that follows the flow consensus
and serves the Access API using local data. This allows anyone to setup an access
node for local queries without the need for staking.

## Running a node

The full observer node was built in collaboration with the `optakt` team. The
primary way to run a full observer node is with the Flow Data Provisioning
Service (DPS).

### Data Provisioning Service

The [Data Provisioning Service](https://github.com/optakt/flow-dps/) provides
efficient access to the full history of flow blockchain data from a single API.
DPS was built by the `optakt` team and greatly streamlines use cases that require
archival data.

For more information on DPS, see their [documentation](https://github.com/optakt/flow-dps/blob/master/docs/introduction.md)

The full observer node functionality is provided by the [DPS Live](https://github.com/optakt/flow-dps/tree/master/cmd/flow-dps-live)
component, which consumes live state updates from the flow network.

### Custom Implementations

Here is an example implementation using the consensus follower library: https://github.com/onflow/full-observer-node-example
