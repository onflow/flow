title: Account Linking Overview
---

Account Linking on Flow enables developers to provide seamless onboarding and in-app experiences while simultaneously empowering users with real ownership and self-sovereignty.  With this model of [hybrid custody](https://forum.onflow.org/t/hybrid-custody/4016), developers can deliver the benefits of both app and self custody in a unified experience.

Account Linking is a process by which an app on Flow establishes a parent-child relationship between an in-app custodial account (child) and a self-custody wallet (parent).  In this process, the child account opts into delegation of control to the parent account, enabling both accounts to control the digital items in the child account.

This shared control over the digital items in the in-app account enables users to establish real ownership of the items beyond the context of the app, where they can use their self-custody wallet to take the items to other apps in the ecosystem, such as a marketplace or a game.  Most importantly, users are able to do this without the need to transfer the digital items between the two accounts, making it seamless to continue using the original app while also using other apps.

With account linking, developers can build walletless onboarding experiences for new users that provide a clear path to self-custody.  Read our Walletless Onboarding guide for more details on how developers can use Account Linking to build these experiences on Flow.
