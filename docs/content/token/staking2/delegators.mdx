# Introduction

This guide covers the technical integration required for a **node operator (NO)** to operate
a staked Flow node using locked FLOW provided by a **token holder (TH)**.

Both parties have separate roles in this relationship:

- **Node Operator:** Manages the node infrastructure but _does not hold_ any FLOW tokens.
- **Token Holder:** Provides restricted, indirect access to their FLOW tokens for the sole purpose of staking.

This guide assumes that **token holder** discovers **node operator** via some mechanism, which will provide operator's **nodeId**

# Setup

These are the steps required to set up the integration between a **token holder** and a **node operator**.

_Note: The corresponding **node operator** steps are outlined in a 
[separate guide for node operators](/token/staking2/node-operators)._

## Register as a Delegator

To register as delegator **token holder** must use transaction TH.12
`lockedTokens/delegator/register_delegator.cdc`

Transaction arguments:

| Argument | Type | Purpose |
| id   | String  | The `nodeId` of the node operator token holder wants to use |
| amount   | UFix64  | The number of FLOW tokens to stake. |


# Delegation Actions

## Delegate New Tokens

To delegate new tokens via the proxy, the **token holder** must use use transaction TH.13:
`lockedTokens/delegator/delegate_new_locked_tokens.cdc`

Transaction arguments:

| Argument | Type | Purpose |
| amount   | UFix64  | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Delegate Unstaked Tokens
To delegate unstaked tokens via the proxy, the **token holder** must use use transaction TH.14:
`lockedTokens/delegator/delegate_locked_unlocked_tokens.cdc`

Transaction arguments:

| Argument | Type | Purpose |
| amount   | UFix64  | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Delegate Rewarded Tokens
To delegate rewarded tokens via the proxy, the **token holder** must use use transaction TH.15:
`lockedTokens/delegator/delegate_locked_rewarded_tokens.cdc`

Transaction arguments:

| Argument | Type | Purpose |
| amount   | UFix64  | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Unstake Delegated Tokens
To send unstake request via the proxy, the **token holder** must use use transaction TH.16:
`lockedTokens/delegator/request_unstaking_locked_delegated_tokens.cdc`

Transaction arguments:

| Argument | Type | Purpose |
| amount   | UFix64  | The number of FLOW tokens to unstake. |

## Withdraw Unstaked Tokens
To withdraw unstaked tokens via the proxy, the **token holder** must use use transaction TH.17:
`lockedTokens/delegator/withdraw_locked_unlocked_delegated_tokens`

Transaction arguments:

| Argument | Type | Purpose |
| amount   | UFix64  | The number of FLOW tokens to withdraw. |

## Withdraw Rewarded Tokens
To withdraw rewarded tokens via the proxy, the **token holder** must use use transaction TH.18:
`lockedTokens/delegator/withdraw_locked_rewarded_delegated_tokens.cdc`

Transaction arguments:

| Argument | Type | Purpose |
| amount   | UFix64  | The number of FLOW tokens to withdraw. |
