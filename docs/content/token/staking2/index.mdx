## Introduction

Flow users can stake their tokens and run nodes in a variety of ways. 
Please select the option that best matches your use case.

1. [For Stakers](/token/staking2/stakers): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to run a node with help from a **node operator**.
1. [For Delegators](/token/staking2/delegators): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to **delegate my tokens** to another node.
1. [For Power Users](/token/staking2/power-users): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to run **my own staked node**.
1. [For Node Operators](/token/staking2/node-operators): I am a **node operator** and I want to help others run nodes.
