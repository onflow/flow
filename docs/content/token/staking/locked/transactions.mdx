# Contracts

## `LockedTokens`

The `LockedTokens` contract defines the resources and interfaces 
used to store locked FLOW tokens owned by a **token holder**.

| Mainnet | `0x8d0e87b65159ae63` |

## `StakingProxy`

The `StakingProxy` contract defines the interfaces through which **token holders** 
and **node operators** perform staking operations with locked FLOW.

# Transactions

## Token Admin

The **token admin** is the administrator responsible for distributing and 
releasing locked FLOW tokens. The **token admin** has possession of a single 
account that is used to control the lockups for all locked FLOW.

The **token admin** creates a **shared account** for each **token holder**
that is co-owned by the **token admin** and the **token holder**. 
The **shared account** is used to store all locked FLOW owned by a **token holder**.

The **token admin** public key is used by account creators to configure **token holder**
accounts to hold locked FLOW.

_Note: these keys have a weight of `100`._

## Token Holder

The **token holder** is a user who holds possession of 
locked and unlocked FLOW tokens.

The **token holder** can stake and delegate locked or unlocked FLOW
through the `StakingProxy` contract.

The **token holder** can withdraw unlocked FLOW from the shared account created 
by the token admin.

### Staking

These transactions operate through the `StakingProxy.NodeStakerProxy` interface.

The  **node operator** can perform the following
staking actions using locked or unlocked FLOW owned by the **token holder**.

_Note: The **node operator** can perform these actions on behalf of 
the **token holder**, but only with explicit permission. 
This permission can be revoked by the **token holder**._
