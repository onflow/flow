# Overview

## Personas

- Token Admin (TA)
- Custodian (C)
- Token Holder (TH)
- Node Operator (NO)

## Use Cases

1. TH stakes directly to their own node
1. TH delegates directly to another node
1. NO operates a staked node
1. TH stakes to a node operated by a NO

# Transactions

## Token Admin

The **token admin** is the administrator responsible for distributing and 
releasing locked FLOW tokens. The **token admin** has possession of a single 
account that is used to control the lockups for all locked FLOW.

The **token admin** creates a **shared account** for each **token holder**
that is co-owned by the **token admin** and the **token holder**. 
The **shared account** is used to store all locked FLOW owned by a **token holder**.

The **token admin** public key is used by account creators to configure **token holder**
accounts to hold locked FLOW.

_Note: these keys have a weight of `100`._

| Network | Token Admin Public Key |

The **token holder** is a user who holds possession of 
locked and unlocked FLOW tokens.

The **token holder** can stake and delegate locked or unlocked FLOW
through the `StakingProxy` contract.

The **token holder** can withdraw unlocked FLOW from the shared account created 
by the token admin.

behalf of a **token holder**.

### Staking

These transactions operate through the `StakingProxy.NodeStakerProxy` interface.

The **node operator** can perform the following
staking actions using locked or unlocked FLOW owned by the **token holder**.

_Note: The **node operator** can perform these actions on behalf of 
the **token holder**, but only with explicit permission. 
This permission can be revoked by the **token holder**._

# Events

The LockedTokens contract defines some events that can be monitored for important actions.

```cadence
pub event SharedAccountRegistered(address: Address)
```
Emitted when a new shared (locked) account is registerd.

```cadence
pub event UnlockedAccountRegistered(address: Address)
```
Emitted when a new user (unlocked) account is registered. This event and `SharedAccountRegistered`
are always emitted at the same time.

```cadence
pub event UnlockLimitIncreased(address: Address, increaseAmount: UFix64, newLimit: UFix64)
```
Emitted when the token admin increases the unlock limit for a locked account.
This will usually happen when a milestone is reached in the vesting of the locked tokens.

```cadence
pub event LockedAccountRegisteredAsNode(address: Address, nodeID: String)
```
Emitted when a user registers their locked account as a node operator.

```cadence
    pub event LockedAccountRegisteredAsDelegator(address: Address, nodeID: String)
```
Emitted when a user registers their locked account as a delegator.

```cadence
    pub event LockedTokensDeposited(address: Address, amount: UFix64)
```
Emitted when the token admin deposits locked tokens from the token sale.
