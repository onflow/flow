title: Staking with Locked FLOW

## Getting Started 

Before a token holder (or a custodian acting on behalf of a holder) can receive 
locked FLOW tokens, they must configure their account with additional functionality 
to handle the vesting schedules and staking actions for tokens in lockup.

Please read the [Account Setup](./setup) guide before proceeding to the remaining
sections.

## Using Locked FLOW

Flow users can stake their tokens and run nodes in a variety of ways. 
Please select the option that best matches your use case.

1. [For Stakers](./stakers): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to run a node with help from a **node operator**.
1. [For Delegators](./delegators): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to **delegate my tokens** to another node.
1. [For Node Operators](./node-operators): I am a **node operator** and I want to help others run nodes.
1. [For Power Users](./power-users): I have **FLOW tokens** and I want to run **my own staked node**.
