title: How to Delegate Locked FLOW
sidebar_title: For Delegators
---

# Introduction

This guide demonstrates how a **token holder** can delegate locked FLOW tokens to 
another node using the `LockedTokens` contract.

# Setup

After the [account setup](../setup) process is complete, 
the **token holder** will have access to a `LockedTokens.TokenHolder` resource in their storage.
This resource can be used as a proxy to indirectly delegate locked FLOW tokens.

## Register as a Delegator

To register as a delegator, the **token holder** can use the **Register Delegator** ([TH.17](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **id**     | `String` | The ID of the node to delegate to. |
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

This transaction registers the account as a delegator to the node ID they specified
and attaches a `NodeDelegatorProxy` capability to the `TokenHolder` resource. 
This capability can later be used to perform delegation actions.

Once an account has registered as a delegator with one node, they cannot register with any others. For more information, see "Register to stake for a different node" below.
This feature will be added in the future.

# Delegation Actions

## Delegate New Tokens

The **token holder** can delegate additional tokens after registering as a delegator. 

_Note: This transaction delegates additional tokens to the same node that was registered in the setup phase.
It is currently not possible to delegate to multiple nodes from the same account._

To delegate new tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Delegate New Locked FLOW** ([TH.19](../transactions/#token-holder)) 
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Re-delegate Unstaked Tokens

After delegated tokens become unstaked, the **token holder** can choose to re-delegate the unstaked tokens to the same node.

To delegate unstaked tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Re-delegate Unstaked FLOW** ([TH.20](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of unstaked FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Re-delegate Rewarded Tokens

After earning rewards from delegation, the **token holder** can choose to re-delegate the rewarded tokens to the same node.

To delegate rewarded tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Re-delegate Rewarded FLOW** ([TH.21](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of rewarded FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Unstake Delegated Tokens

The **token holder** can submit a request to unstake their delegated tokens at any time.

To unstake delegated tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Unstake Delegated FOW** ([TH.22](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to unstake. |

_Note: unstaked delegated tokens will be held by the central staking contract for a period of time 
(the rest of the current epoch plus all of the next epoch) before they are 
released to the token holder. Once the tokens are released (unstaked), 
they can be claimed via the [Withdraw Unstaked Tokens](#withdraw-unstaked-tokens) action below._

## Withdraw Unstaked Tokens

After delegated tokens become unstaked, the **token holder** can withdraw them from the central staking contract.

To withdraw unstaked tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Withdraw Unstaked FLOW ** ([TH.23](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of unstaked FLOW tokens to withdraw. |

This transaction moves the unstaked tokens back into the `LockedTokens.Lockbox` owned by the **token holder**.

## Withdraw Rewarded Tokens

After earning rewards from delegation, the **token holder** can withdraw them from the central staking contract.

To withdraw rewarded tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Withdraw Rewarded FLOW** ([TH.24](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of rewarded FLOW tokens to withdraw. |

This transaction moves the rewarded tokens back into the `LockedTokens.Lockbox` owned by the **token holder**. 
However, unlike unstaked tokens, rewards are **unlocked FLOW** and can be immediately withdrawn from the lockbox.

## Getting Info about an accounts delegation

To return a struct with all the information associated with a delegator, anyone
can use the **Get Delegator Info** ([TH.21](../transactions/#token-holder)) script with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **nodeID** | `String` | The 32 byte ID of the node of the delegator |
| **nodeID** | `UInt8`  | The ID of the delegator |

This script returns a `FlowIDTableStaking.DelegatorInfo` [struct.](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/contracts/FlowIDTableStaking.cdc#L348)
