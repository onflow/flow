title: How to Delegate Locked FLOW
sidebar_title: For Delegators

# Introduction

This guide demonstrates how a **token holder** can delegate locked FLOW tokens to 
another node using the `LockedTokens` contract.

# Setup

After the [account setup](../setup) process is complete, 
the **token holder** will have access to a `LockedTokens.TokenHolder` resource in their storage.
This resource can be used as a proxy to indirectly delegate locked FLOW tokens.

## Register as a Delegator

To register as a delegator, the **token holder** can use the **Register Delegator** ([TH.12](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **id**     | `String` | The ID of the node to delegate to. |
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

This transaction attaches a `NodeDelegatorProxy` capability to the `TokenHolder` resource. 
This capability can later be used to perform delegation actions.

# Delegation Actions

## Delegate New Tokens

The **token holder** can delegate additional tokens after registering as a delegator. 

_Note: This transaction delegates additional tokens to the same node that was registered in the setup phase.
It is currently not possible to delegate to multiple nodes from the same account._

To delegate new tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Delegate New Locked FLOW** ([TH.13](../transactions/#token-holder)) 
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Re-delegate Unstaked Tokens

After delegated tokens become unstaked, the **token holder** can choose to re-delegate the unstaked tokens to the same node.

To delegate unstaked tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Re-delegate Unstaked FLOW** ([TH.14](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of unstaked FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Re-delegate Rewarded Tokens

After earning rewards from delegation, the **token holder** can choose to re-delegate the rewarded tokens to the same node.

To delegate rewarded tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Re-delegate Rewarded FLOW** ([TH.15](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of rewarded FLOW tokens to delegate. |

## Unstake Delegated Tokens

The **token holder** can submit a request to unstake their delegated tokens at any time.

To unstake delegated tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Unstake Delegated FOW** ([TH.16](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of FLOW tokens to unstake. |

_Note: unstaked delegated tokens will be held by the central staking contract for a period of time before they are 
released to the token holder. Once the tokens are released (unstaked), 
they can be claimed via the [Withdraw Unstaked Tokens](#withdraw-unstaked-tokens) action below._

## Withdraw Unstaked Tokens

After delegated tokens become unstaked, the **token holder** can withdraw them from the central staking contract.

To withdraw unstaked tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Withdraw Unstaked FLOW ** ([TH.17](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of unstaked FLOW tokens to withdraw. |

This transaction moves the unstaked tokens back into the `LockedTokens.Lockbox` owned by the **token holder**.

## Withdraw Rewarded Tokens

After earning rewards from delegation, the **token holder** can withdraw them from the central staking contract.

To withdraw rewarded tokens via the `NodeDelegatorProxy`, 
the **token holder** can use the **Withdraw Rewarded FLOW** ([TH.18](../transactions/#token-holder))
transaction with the following arguments:

| Argument   | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **amount** | `UFix64` | The number of rewarded FLOW tokens to withdraw. |

This transaction moves the rewarded tokens back into the `LockedTokens.Lockbox` owned by the **token holder**. 
However, unlike unstaked tokens, rewards are **unlocked FLOW** and can be immediately withdrawn from the lockbox.
