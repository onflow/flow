If you want to be a node operator, you first need to generate your staking key,
networking address, node ID, and networking key.
Please consult the [guide](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/node-operation-consolidated-guide) to read about how to do that.

You then need to determine the role of node you'll be running (Collector, Consensus, Execution, Verification, or Access)

## Staking

If you hold tokens and want to participate in the network as a node operator.
you need to [stake](custody-staking-and-delivery#staking) your tokens.

### Staking as a Service - Using the Staking Helper Contract

If you do not hold tokens and are relying on someone else to stake tokens for your node,
you can [submit a staking request without tokens](custody-staking-and-delivery#staking-helper) -
this will register your node and produce the needed node operator object that the token holder
can use to stake their tokens for your node. These kind of arrangements are usually moderated by an
off-chain legal agreement.

### Allowing other Users to trustlessly Delegate tokens to your node
If you operate a node and want to allow other token holders to delegate tokens to your node without an off-chain legal agreement,
you can [enable delegation for your node](custody-staking-and-delivery#delegation), which allows any user to commit stake for your node 
and receive a proportional percentage of your node's rewards, as determined by you.

## Unstaking / Withdrawing Stake and Rewards

Stake can be [unstaked / withdrawn](custody-staking-and-delivery#unstaking-withdrawing-stake)
after a week-long lock-up.

Rewards are deposited into their own pool of reward tokens.
You can [withdraw these tokens at anytime](custody-staking-and-delivery#withdrawing-rewards).
You can also [re-stake them](custody-staking-and-delivery#staking-unstaked-stake), if desired.
