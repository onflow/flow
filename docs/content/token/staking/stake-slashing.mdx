## Slashing

Severe slashing on Flow only takes place in the most nefarious of attacks. 
The protocol reserves slashing for maintaining the security of the protocol rather than its liveness.
You can find more details on the conditions under which a node is slashed in the Flow whitepapers.

While a node is in operation and during the unstaking period after they request unstaking,
the staked tokens are held by the staking smart contract.
Slashable protocol violations must be adjudicated by a supermajority 
of more than 2/3 of the staked consensus nodes in order to take effect.
If a node is found guilty of committing a slashable protocol violation, 
the consensus nodes directly deduct a fine from the node's stake. 
Of course, only the remaining stake is deposited back into node's balance
at the end of the unstaking period.

Slashing is not handled by the staking contract at this point. 
It will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Once full epoch functionality is enabled,
slashing will be handled by the protocol.
