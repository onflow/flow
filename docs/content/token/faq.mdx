### Are FLOW token holders obligated to run nodes? 

FLOW token holders are not required to run nodes. However, even locked tokens are eligible for staking and delegation, and we encourage any token holders who don't run a node to delegate their locked tokens to a trusted node operator in order to receive staking rewards.

### Can FLOW token holders stake their full FLOW balance or only the unlocked balance?

Flow token holders have their full FLOW balance available for staking and delegation. The unlocked balance will come from staking rewards, this amount is freely transferable.

### When will FLOW tokens be transferable?

FLOW tokens from the CoinList Community Sale have a two-year lockup period, with 50% of the tokens unlocking after one year. Locked tokens cannot be transferred but they are eligible for staking and delegation during the lockup period. There's more info here: https://coinlist.co/flow.

FLOW tokens from the CoinList Auction tokens have a one-year lockup period. They are also eligible for staking and delegation during the lockup period.

Staking rewards are freely transferable as soon as they are claimed. 

### When can I delegate my tokens?

All of our token custody partners are working hard to get staking and delegation support ready ASAP. We’ll share more details as they are available. Rest assured you will have plenty of notice to delegate your tokens before staking rewards begin to accrue.

### How much will CoinList charge for storage and staking FLOW tokens?

There are no fees for storing and staking your FLOW tokens with CoinList. If you choose to stake or delegate your tokens, 8% of the staking rewards go to the node operator you delegate to, with the remaining being credited to your account. This 8% fee is mandated by the protocol to offset the operational cost of running the node software. CoinList does not charge any additional fees for staking.

### When are staking and delegation rewards paid out?

Rewards are paid at the end of each “epoch” (a time period encoded into the protocol, equalling one week), to all node operators and their delegates who locked their tokens in at the beginning of that epoch. The first epoch will take place in mid-November. We will provide additional updates about how to participate in staking and delegation well before the first epoch’s deadline. 

### Who is running Flow nodes and how can I get in touch with them?

There are a number of teams currently running a node on the Flow network including companies like Samsung, Ubisoft, and T-Systems (a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom); non-profits and academic institutions like Cal Berkeley, Yonsei University, and the Andreessen Horowitz Cultural Leadership Fund; as well as crypto funds and infrastructure providers including Bison Trails, StakeFish, Figment Networks, and 50+ others. More details coming soon.
