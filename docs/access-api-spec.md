## RPC Service

The Access API is implemented as a [gRPC service](https://grpc.io/).

A language-agnostic specification for this API is defined using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), which can be used to generate client libraries in a variety of programming languages.

- [Flow Access API protobuf source file](/protobuf/flow/access/access.proto)

### Ping

`Ping` will return a successful response if the Access API is ready and available.

### Transactions

The following methods can be used to submit [transactions](#transaction) and fetch their results.

#### SendTransaction

`SendTransaction` submits a transaction to the network.

```
rpc SendTransaction (SendTransactionRequest) returns (SendTransactionResponse)
```

`SendTransaction` determines the correct cluster of collector nodes that is responsible for collecting the transaction based on the hash of the transaction and forwards the transaction to that cluster.

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  `SendTransactionRequest` message contains the transaction that is being request to be executed.

  ```
  message SendTransactionRequest {
    flow.Transaction transaction
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>
  
  `SendTransactionResponse` message contains the ID of the submitted transaction.

  ```
  message SendTransactionResponse {
    bytes id
  }
  ```
</details>

#### GetTransaction

`GetTransaction` gets a [transaction](#transaction) by ID.

If the transaction is not found in the access node cache, the request is forwarded to a collection node.

_Currently, only transactions within the current epoch can be queried._

```
rpc GetTransaction (GetTransactionRequest) returns (TransactionResponse)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  `GetTransactionRequest` contains the ID of the transaction that is being queried.

  ```
  message GetTransactionRequest {
    bytes id
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>
  
  `TransactionResponse` contains the basic information about a transaction, but does not include post-execution results.

  ```
  message TransactionResponse {
    flow.Transaction transaction
  }
  ```
</details>

#### GetTransactionResult

`GetTransactionResult` gets the execution result of a transaction.

```
rpc GetTransactionResult (GetTransactionRequest) returns (TransactionResultResponse)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```
  message GetTransactionRequest {
    bytes id
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>
  
  ```
  message TransactionResultResponse {
    flow.TransactionStatus status
    uint32 status_code
    string error_message
    repeated flow.Event events
  }
  ```
</details>

--- 

### Accounts

#### GetAccount

`GetAccount` gets an [account](#account) by address.

The access node queries an execution node for the account details, which are stored as part of the execution state.

```
rpc GetAccount(GetAccountRequest) returns (GetAccountResponse)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```
  message GetAccountRequest {
    bytes address
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>
  
  ```
  message GetAccountResponse {
    Account account
  }
  ```
</details>

---

### Scripts

#### ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock

`ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock` executes a read-only Cadance script against the latest sealed execution state.

This method can be used to read execution state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](/docs/json-cadence-spec.md).

```
rpc ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock (ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlockRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```

This method is a shortcut for the following:

```
header = GetLatestBlockHeader()
value = ExecuteScriptAtBlockID(header.ID, script)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```
  message ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlockRequest {
    bytes script
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>
  
  ```
  message ExecuteScriptResponse {
    bytes value
  }
  ```
</details>

#### ExecuteScriptAtBlockID

`ExecuteScriptAtBlockID` executes a ready-only Cadence script against the execution state at the block with the given ID.

This method can be used to read account state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](/docs/cadence-json-spec.md).

```
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockID (ExecuteScriptAtBlockIDRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```
  message ExecuteScriptAtBlockIDRequest {
    bytes block_id
    bytes script
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>
  
  ```
  message ExecuteScriptResponse {
    bytes value
  }
  ```
</details>

#### ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight

`ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight` executes a ready-only Cadence script against the execution state at the given block height.

This method can be used to read account state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](/docs/cadence-json-spec.md).

```
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight (ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```
  message ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest {
    uint64 block_height
    bytes script
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>
  
  ```
  message ExecuteScriptResponse {
    bytes value
  }
  ```
</details>

---

### Events

The following methods can be used to query for on-chain [events](#event).

#### GetEventsForHeightRange

`GetEventsForHeightRange` retrieves [events](#event) emitted within the specified block range.

```
rpc GetEventsForHeightRange(GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest) returns (GetEventsForHeightRangeResponse)
```

Events can be requested for a specific sealed block range via the `start_height` and `end_height` (inclusive) fields and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

If `end_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return events up to and including the latest sealed block.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID and height.

Event types are namespaced with the address of the account and contract in which they are declared.

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```
  message GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest {
    string type
    uint64 start_height = 2;
    uint64 end_height = 3;
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>
  
  ```
  message EventsResponse {
    message Result {
      bytes block_id = 1;
      uint64 block_height = 2;
      repeated entities.Event events = 3;
    }
    repeated Result results = 1;
  }
  ```
</details>

#### GetEventsForBlockIDs

`GetEventsForBlockIDs` retrieves [events](#event) for the specified block IDs and event type.
```
rpc GetEventsForBlockIDs(GetEventsForBlockIDsRequest) returns (GetEventsForBlockIDsResponse)
```

Events can be requested for a list of block IDs via the `block_ids` field and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID and height.

<details>
  <summary>Request</summary>

  ```
  message GetEventsForBlockIDsRequest {
    string type = 1;
    repeated bytes block_ids = 2;
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Response</summary>

  ```
  message EventsResponse {
    message Result {
      bytes block_id = 1;
      uint64 block_height = 2;
      repeated entities.Event events = 3;
    }
    repeated Result results = 1;
  }
  ```
</details>
