# Team Wins üéâ
- Migrated 100% mainnet gRPC traffic to QuickNode
- Published [Storehouse Design Doc](https://dapperlabs.notion.site/Storehouse-Design-Whiteboard-2f38e27891fc4e3e91415dbce240f175) so that it is accessible by the commnity.
- Successfully deployed fix to mitigate protocol state growth on execution nodes by periodically pruning chuck data packs for sealed blocks.
- Seucessful release of [Stable Cadence preview](https://github.com/onflow/flow-cli/releases/tag/v1.5.0-stable-cadence.1)

### Mainnet Uptime SLO - Last 14 days (8/18 to 9/1)

|                         | Target | Current Score | Error budget used |
|:------------------------|:------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| Collection Finalizatoin | 99.9%  |    99.985%    |       14.9%       |
| Block Finalization      | 99.9%  |    99.975%    |       24.8%       |
| Transaction Execution   | 99.9%  |    99.98%     |       19.8%       |
| Block Sealing           | 99.9%  |    99.94%     |       59.5%       |
| Access API Liveness     | 99.9%  |    99.97%     |       29.8%       |

*99.9% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~20m8s for a 14-day window.*

*99% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~3hr20min for a 14-day window.*
