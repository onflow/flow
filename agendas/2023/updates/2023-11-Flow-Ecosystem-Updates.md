### Tooling, infrastructure and other software for builders
1. [Contract Browser](https://contractbrowser.com/blog/introducing-v2) V2 launched which makes discovering, interacting and viewing smart contracts seamless as well as massively supporting composability.
2. [FlowComponents](http://github.com/Forge4Flow/FlowComponents) Beta an open-source SwiftUI library tailored to simplify the development of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Flow Blockchain. This comprehensive library comprises reusable SwiftUI views, modifiers, and extensions, offering an intuitive and feature-rich toolkit for crafting user interfaces specifically designed for Flow-based projects.

### Protocol, core contracts and node updates

### Cadence and smart contract updates
1. Hosted community Smart Contract engineering open houses that collaborated with the ecosystem to finalize designs and plans for the Hybrid custody smart contract standard and the V2 token standards.
2. [FLIP 179](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/179) covering scheduled contract updates was approved and will be used for Cadence 1.0 migrations
Randomness made its way to Mainnet with indefinite random source history running on [RandomBeaconHistory].

## Grant project updates

Articles and Content - [Fullstackpho](https://github.com/ph0ph0) wrote an articles on [Flow Node types](https://fullstackpho.com/types-of-node-on-flow-blockchain) as well as created a [guide and starter project](https://fullstackpho.com/how-to-use-shell-scripts-to-speed-up-cadence-development-on-flow-blockchain) for using shell scripts to super charge Cadence development and testing.

Overhauled Cookbook - The Cadence Cookbook got a major overhaul led by [Lea](lealobanov (Lea Lobanov)) with a brand new modern UI and recipe architecture, improved contribution flow for adding recipes, integrated front-end and Cadence testing, and SEO updates. Release of Cookbook updates is targeted for the first week of December.

Wonder Arena - [Wonderland](https://bbwonderland.com/) a gamified social experience for Web3 NFTs has launched for the top Flow collections [Flovatar](https://flovatar.com/) & [Basic Beasts](https://www.basicbeasts.io/). Holders can now send their NFTs on quests and receive weekly rewards. Rewards have different rarities & unlock new digital experiences for holders. Furthermore, the team behind Wonder Arena is launching a free mint of [$LIBZ a brc-20 token](https://twitter.com/LIBZ_BRC20) to bring Flow's composability to Bitcoin Ordinals & degen culture to Flow. Both initiatives have shown promising traction with hundreds of NFTs being quested on Wonderland & 23,200 users being waitlisted & allowlisted for the free mint of $LIBZ within 2 weeks. Updates on both projects can be followed on [@OrdinalsGlobal_](https://twitter.com/OrdinalsGlobal_) & [@bz_bbclub](https://twitter.com/bz_bbclub)
