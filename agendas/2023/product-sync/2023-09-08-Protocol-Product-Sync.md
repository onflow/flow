_Please add your topics of disucssion here_

1. Spork date - Mainnet: 1st Nov, Testnet: 18th Oct
     


2. Bigbeats for the upcoming spork

  - Atree inling
  - Execution data verification
  - Groundwork for script execution on Access node.
  - Low level functionality for the secure randomness for Cadence
  - REST implementation of the event streaming API
  
  Comb through the commits on master to identify any other big beats - Peter and Jan.

3. Vaccumlabs update
  - Ledger needs to be updated for stable cadence.
  - Extra Ledger audit cost needs to be added.
  - Explore options - in-house engineering and/or hybrid work.
  Jan and Kshitij - to explore these options.
  


4. Atree register inlining migration ETA to run for 2-3 hours. 
 - Piecemeal migration via HCU not possible
 - could experiment with having an EN using the new node software on mainnet-23, executing transactions and then using that for state extraction during the spork.
 - 
 Vishal - to figure out impact.
  - Engineering effort needed to reduce the time? Difficult to asses at this time without more experimentation; few weeks atleast

Jan to check if and how the migration could be made faster
