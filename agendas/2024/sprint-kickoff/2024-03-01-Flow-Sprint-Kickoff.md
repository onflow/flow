### **Governance and Tokenomics** \[Kshitij]
Cycle Objective(s): Transaction fees on EVM, increasing transaction fees and inflation reduction plan.

**Done last sprint**

* Gas to computation ratio set at 1000:1 for the PreviewNet launch, with a consideration for evaluating a higher ratio of 3000:1 based on Flow's capacity to handle higher gas transactions. See [internal doc](https://www.notion.so/dapperlabs/Gas-fees-on-Flow-EVM-b7419203c5054562a0be7fd91fc9fc66#c43bbd475a6b44b7a8bc25f9e357e720) for more explanation.
* Developer documentation (including internal documentation) for FlowEVM gas fees created.
* Flow fees for five key transaction types have been evaluated. See [worksheet 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PPxxAotsIYLzydAnuBAgQe1BmEcamiuSQUmsDtrpaKs/edit#gid=0)
* Drove research on inflation and levers to reduce it via a combination of reward rate and transaction fee increase, with the goal of keeping APY comeptitive. The ideas will be presented to the GWG in the coming sprint. See [draft note](https://www.notion.so/dapperlabs/FLOW-Inflation-forum-post-for-community-ideation-3f256d4e1b5b48b6adaabb22d6b22567)
* WIP - A high-level governance strategy is under development 
* WIP - The impact of increasing the computation limit is being assessed

**This sprint**

* Estimation of execution effort for FlowEVM transactionsÂ and determining the ratios and differences between Flow Cadence and FlowEVM transaction fees (for better comms)
* Finalize the decision regarding increasing the computation limit
* Drive GWG meeting and provide community updates on recent changes
* Publish forum post detailing the computation limit and transaction fee increases and invite feedback
* Outreach to partners regarding the upcoming transaction fee increase
* Conduct research on storage fees related to EVM
