# Overview

### Team Wins 🎉
- Finished deploying script execution to public QN nodes (live on 100% of public and studio nodes). Seeing a [70% reduction](https://flowfoundation.grafana.net/d/ddnerazd84um8d/script-execution?orgId=1&editPanel=3&from=now-60d&to=now) in script execution on the execution nodes since May.
- Mainnet Crescendo migration environment now successfuly bootstrapped and passing end-to-end tests.
- Atree register inlining migration [performance improved by ~10%](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/6193).
- Polished Flow Port to release ready state
- Submitted Ledger Flow app (0.13.0) for approval after successfull Ledger Live testing
- Completed Rosetta C1.0 updates and integration testing. Now handed off to Coinbase for acceptance testing

# Working Group Updates

### **Cadence and Virtual Machine** \[Jan]
Cycle Objective(s):

1) Upgrade Mainnet to Crescendo Release with minimal impact on developers, to lower the barrier for cross chain liquidity on Flow
2) Calibrate Transaction fees so that they accurately reflect resource usage during execution and deploy as part of Crescendo to avoid future disruption.
3) Analyze execution runtime trends and risks to plan next set of scalability OKRs.

* Stretch-goals:
4) Expand testing capability of storehouse so that we can validate execution correctness and benchmark performance on Mainnet data
5) Design a new Trie to improve performance of update operation, reduce memory usage and size of proofs and to support more flexible proof queries.
6) Enable Concurrent Execution on one EN on Mainnet to validate correctness of the implementation (Detect execution forks)
7) Improve execution performance to mitigate the impact of adding metadata to token standards
