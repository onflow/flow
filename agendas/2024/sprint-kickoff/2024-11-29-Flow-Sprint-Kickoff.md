# Overview

 ### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰
 
 * Flow has been added to [chainspect.app](https://chainspect.app/dashboard) (Vishal)
 * Hyperlane cbBTC bridge tested and live for mainnet but not yet announced
 * Deployed EVM GW with dry-run feature on TN - enables more flexibility in configuring EVM traces and reduces load on ANs.
 * Deployed last remaining Cadence security report.
 * Great Cadence team mini-onsite, discussed Cadence compiler workstream and aligned on next steps.
 * Discussed and agreed on the trigger mechanism for first on-the-fly migration (to be used for non-atree domain register inlining).
 * Completed all Cadence language tech-debt removal tasks planned for this cycle.
 * Completed first Cadence compiler + VM OKR - benchmarking removed Move VM as potential candidate for runtime for performance reasons.

### **Governance - Vishal**

Cycle Objective(s):

3. Continue building a well-structured Flow Tokenomics framework to enhance community understanding, improve perception, and articulate a clear long-term vision
4. Build and ship a new dashboard to provide node operators with real-time access to staking, epoch-related and other relevant data.

**Done last sprint**
* Reached out to all inactive multi-signers
* Implemented FLIPS to remove two signers who no longer wished to continue as signers.
* Discussed potential node operator lease to Dorahacks and Alchemy.
* Synced with T-systems on various topics - node operations, self-custody instead of using a custodian etc.
* Requested FindLabs for additional REST API to enable grafana alerting on node counts.
* Time to finality discussion with Chainspect.app.

**This sprint**
* Lease account setup for Coinage/DAIC (new node operator)
* Send out the lease contract for Dorahacks.
