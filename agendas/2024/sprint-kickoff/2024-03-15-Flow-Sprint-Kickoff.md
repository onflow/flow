# Overview

 ### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰
 
* [CLI release](https://github.com/onflow/flow-cli/releases/tag/v1.12.0-cadence-v1.0.0-preview.9) that enables local contract migration testing to Cadence 1.0 with emulator is going through [last round of testing](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/3098).
* Great progress on the C1.0 migrations, now passes on full TN state, taking ~7.5 hours on m1-ultramem-160.
* C1.0 TN migration environment - successfully started the network from migrated TN state and executed system transaction.
* Bluesign helping with migration, found 2 optimizations - community power!
* Completed another Atree optimization that reduces RAM and persistent storage usage on ENs: [Deduplicating Cadence dictionary type info](https://github.com/onflow/atree/issues/358)
* Cross-VM bridge design changes now locked in and moving ahead with delivery
* Cadence contracts test boilerplate now included in CLI `generate` command
* CLI updates - Cadence lint command added, New CLI build addressing crypto library changes now supported on master and stable cadence branches, `flow dev` command now starts emulator automatically
* Documentation - Cadence 1.0 Staging and state migration docs added

# Working Group Updates

### **Cadence and Virtual Machine** \[Jan]
Cycle Objective(s):

1) Upgrade Mainnet to Crescendo Release with minimal impact on developers, to lower the barrier for cross chain liquidity on Flow
2) Calibrate Transaction fees so that they accurately reflect resource usage during execution and deploy as part of Crescendo to avoid future disruption.
3) Analyze execution runtime trends and risks to plan next set of scalability OKRs.

* Stretch-goals:
4) Expand testing capability of storehouse so that we can validate execution correctness and benchmark performance on Mainnet data
5) Design a new Trie to improve performance of update operation, reduce memory usage and size of proofs and to support more flexible proof queries.
6) Enable Concurrent Execution on one EN on Mainnet to validate correctness of the implementation (Detect execution forks)
7) Improve execution performance to mitigate the impact of adding metadata to token standards

### **Governance and Tokenomics** \[Kshitij]
Cycle Objective(s): Transaction fees on EVM, increasing transaction fees and inflation reduction plan.

**Done last sprint**
- Estimation of execution effort for EVM transactions on FlowÂ and determining the ratios and differences between Flow Cadence and Flow EVM transaction fees
- Evaluation of the impact of EIP 4844 on L2 transaction fees and Flow's planned 100x increase [see document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PPxxAotsIYLzydAnuBAgQe1BmEcamiuSQUmsDtrpaKs/edit#gid=1064090175)
- Assessed how much computation can fit into a block and thus decided to raise the computation limit by 5x
- Finalized computation conversion ratio of 5000:1, and a 100x transaction fee increase - forum post and FLIP to follow
- Drove GWG meeting and provided community updates on recent changes

**This sprint**

- Publish forum post detailing the computation limit, gas to compute conversion, and the transaction fee increase
- EIP 4844 vs Flow analysis - create self explanatory publicly available spreadsheets, write a blog post
- Partner outreach regarding the upcoming transaction fee increase
- Model inflation reduction via two methods - (1) a planned reduction in reward rate over time like sol, and (2) a capped reward number that reduces inflation over time when the cap hits in future
- Finalize cresendo related governance and tokenomics plan
- Consensus node rebalancing exercise to maintain decentralization
