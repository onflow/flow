# Working Group Updates

### **Cadence and Virtual Machine** \[Jan]
Cycle Objective(s):

1) Upgrade Mainnet to Crescendo Release with minimal impact on developers, to lower the barrier for cross chain liquidity on Flow
2) Calibrate Transaction fees so that they accurately reflect resource usage during execution and deploy as part of Crescendo to avoid future disruption.
3) Analyze execution runtime trends and risks to plan next set of scalability OKRs.

* Stretch-goals:
4) Expand testing capability of storehouse so that we can validate execution correctness and benchmark performance on Mainnet data
5) Design a new Trie to improve performance of update operation, reduce memory usage and size of proofs and to support more flexible proof queries.
6) Enable Concurrent Execution on one EN on Mainnet to validate correctness of the implementation (Detect execution forks)
7) Improve execution performance to mitigate the impact of adding metadata to token standards

**Done last sprint**
- Forum [post](https://forum.flow.com/t/proposing-transaction-fee-changes-and-flow-evm-gas-charges-for-flow-crescendo-launch/5817) regarding proposals on EVM gas and transaction fee published.
- Modeled inflation reduction options and had the first round of internal discussion; additional research is needed on new potential options. See deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EBYqB8FwxHtOwaQMHiId0ZZv4bRNThNYrgF5-CZeI8M/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g26c5efcb5cb_0_280)
- Impact of transaction fee increase on partner costs was assessed by pulling the latest data for the top 20 transaction payers on Flow. Discussions were held with BD/partnership team, and the timeline for partner outreach is set for mid-May. See research [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PPxxAotsIYLzydAnuBAgQe1BmEcamiuSQUmsDtrpaKs/edit#gid=1414811201)

- Gather and respond to community feedback on the forum post
- For decentralization efforts, work with a16z to consolidate three nodes, and with Coinbase to reduce one node they operate on leased stake
- Continue work on automation of the decentralization dashboard to send messages when critical thresholds are crossed
- Draft FLIP on EVM gas to compute ratio and compute limit hike.
- Update FLIP on transaction fee to suggest a transaction fee multiplier closely tied to FLOW token's market price
