# Overview

### Team Wins üéâ

- [EVM FLIP](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/272) is approved and accepted.
- Crescendo state migration on MN state reduced from ~37 to ~5 hours total migration time
- Successfully deployed Crescendo readiness audit on Testnet - execution mode where transactions importing unstaged contracts fail with error message linking to upcoming Crescendo release.
- Released all Cadence language breaking changes in both flow-go release used for migration and CLI.
- Deployed new execution node ingestion engine to Mainnet (enabled on one EN) and so far running successfully for the last ~2 weeks. This enables us to boot EN anywhere in the spork and it will catch up, while previously it would crash if it was too far behind.
- Successfully upgraded previewnet to latest flow-go master and got EVM working End-End.
- Successfully got the EVM Gateway working on Migration environment.
- Released Foundry guide for EVM
- Deployed multicall smartcontract to EVM previewnet and integrated it with viem
- Proved out onboarding and bridging EVM FT to Cadence and bridging Cadence FT to EVM in Flow Port.
- Updated  FT, NFT, and metadata views guides to Cadence 1.0
- Finished Cadence 1.0 changes for NFTStorefront and included it in testnet migrations
- CLI Staging Imjprovements: Added ability to stage & validate entire project in one command to CLI, Warn users if staged contracts are no longer valid in the CLI when running commands
- Protocol State Snapshot updated -> can be constructed from any reference block
- Development on Zero-downtime Upgrades of Node Software are complete, ready to deploy in next network update
- Took delivery of initial implementation of Rosetta for Flow EVM which is needed for CB integration with EVM

## Incidents

## Core protocol incidents

### Mainnet
- May 10th: Sev-2 - Execution stopped on FlowFoundation execution nodes for ~5 mins. Root cause: All FF nodes in `us-central` seem to have gone down for a few minutes. Postmortem available [here](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/Mainnet-GCP-Network-Outage-5-10-f2c2380ab5454481b8170836bf64db6c?pvs=4#f7981c0fc3b54ccc9c64ae8470b9788f)
- May 10th: Sev-3 - EN1 failed to restart (part of the same issue ‚òùÔ∏è)
- May 19th: Sev-3 - EN1 crashed. Currently being investigated: https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/5956.

### Testnet
- May 20th: Sev-1 - ENs on testnet forked and sealing halted. Testnet underwent a network upgrade (spork) [Slack thread](https://dapperlabs.slack.com/archives/CUU2KQL4A/p1716230568407649)

# Working Group Updates

### **Cadence and Virtual Machine** \[Jan]
Cycle Objective(s):

1) Upgrade Mainnet to Crescendo Release with minimal impact on developers, to lower the barrier for cross chain liquidity on Flow
2) Calibrate Transaction fees so that they accurately reflect resource usage during execution and deploy as part of Crescendo to avoid future disruption.
3) Analyze execution runtime trends and risks to plan next set of scalability OKRs.

* Stretch-goals:
4) Expand testing capability of storehouse so that we can validate execution correctness and benchmark performance on Mainnet data
5) Design a new Trie to improve performance of update operation, reduce memory usage and size of proofs and to support more flexible proof queries.
6) Enable Concurrent Execution on one EN on Mainnet to validate correctness of the implementation (Detect execution forks)
7) Improve execution performance to mitigate the impact of adding metadata to token standards
