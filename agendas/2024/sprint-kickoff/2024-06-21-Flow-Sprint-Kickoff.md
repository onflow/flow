# Overview

### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰
- Deprecated K8s clusters that will result in $6.5k per month in infra savings (JP)
- Script execution on the access node turned on for NBA nodes successfully.
- Script execution turned on 50% of the public access node.
- 2 remaining Testnet upgrade blockers in Cadence 1.0 resolved!
    - Performance of execution state diff tool was [improved 50x]((https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/6107)) - this enabled us to validate and close the last remaining Cadence 1.0 migration blocker.
        - Successfuly validated last remaining Cadence 1.0 migration issue ([dictionary key migration](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/3407))
    - [FLIP for changing import statement semantics](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/277) approved - this removed last Crescendo blocker in Cadence 1.0.
- Completed 2 EVM GW Features that were Testnet upgrade blockers: [Securing Flow account keys](https://github.com/onflow/flow-evm-gateway/issues/250) and [Fee history API](https://github.com/onflow/flow-evm-gateway/issues/143).
- EN Badger DB -> Pebble DB POC - devnet ENs are running with pebble-based chunk data pack storage, disk usage growth slowed down from 1.7% to 1% / day.
- Transaction Audit / inpection logic now [supports percentage-based transaction failure mode](https://github.com/onflow/contract-updater/pull/35), using on-chain randomness.
- Crescendo Rewards BE fully set up with CI/CD on staging and production (thanks alex!)
- Flow decentralization is now fully restored. No operator runs >1/3 of 94 consensus nodes

# Working Group Updates

### **Cadence and Virtual Machine** \[Jan]
Cycle Objective(s):

1) Upgrade Mainnet to Crescendo Release with minimal impact on developers, to lower the barrier for cross chain liquidity on Flow
2) Calibrate Transaction fees so that they accurately reflect resource usage during execution and deploy as part of Crescendo to avoid future disruption.
3) Analyze execution runtime trends and risks to plan next set of scalability OKRs.

* Stretch-goals:
4) Expand testing capability of storehouse so that we can validate execution correctness and benchmark performance on Mainnet data
5) Design a new Trie to improve performance of update operation, reduce memory usage and size of proofs and to support more flexible proof queries.
6) Enable Concurrent Execution on one EN on Mainnet to validate correctness of the implementation (Detect execution forks)
7) Improve execution performance to mitigate the impact of adding metadata to token standards
