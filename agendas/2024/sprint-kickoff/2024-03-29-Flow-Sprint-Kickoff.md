# Working Group Updates

### **Cadence and Virtual Machine** \[Jan]
Cycle Objective(s):

1) Upgrade Mainnet to Crescendo Release with minimal impact on developers, to lower the barrier for cross chain liquidity on Flow
2) Calibrate Transaction fees so that they accurately reflect resource usage during execution and deploy as part of Crescendo to avoid future disruption.
3) Analyze execution runtime trends and risks to plan next set of scalability OKRs.

* Stretch-goals:
4) Expand testing capability of storehouse so that we can validate execution correctness and benchmark performance on Mainnet data
5) Design a new Trie to improve performance of update operation, reduce memory usage and size of proofs and to support more flexible proof queries.
6) Enable Concurrent Execution on one EN on Mainnet to validate correctness of the implementation (Detect execution forks)
7) Improve execution performance to mitigate the impact of adding metadata to token standards

### **Governance and Tokenomics** \[Kshitij]
Cycle Objective(s): Transaction fees on EVM, increasing transaction fees and inflation reduction plan.

**Done last sprint**

* Forum post detailing the computation limit, gas to compute conversion, and the transaction fee increase was drafted; currently under review. See [draft](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/Forum-post-Proposing-Flow-fees-and-computation-limit-related-changes-e1793d993ed1412f968229dc58217b21)
* Two inflation reduction strategies were considered and modeled - see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jr-P9ZQB3hDEZFh3pjktRnhIe0jFrMz4hn4_EFGHfK4/edit#gid=991805613). Option 1: Reduce reward rate in a predictable way over time until a baseline cut-off (like solana). Option 2: Cap the maximum absolute value of weekly issuance to drive lower inflation in future when that cap hits. Summary available in this [draft deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EBYqB8FwxHtOwaQMHiId0ZZv4bRNThNYrgF5-CZeI8M/edit#slide=id.g26c5efcb5cb_0_280)
* Cresendo related governance and tokenomics plan was put together. See [here](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/a6eb68ded7b548138cc414caa4a3b224?v=20ffb677a9da49f4bc2da33e2e0501e4)
* Transaction fee comparison between EIP-4844 vs Flow was finalized, available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PPxxAotsIYLzydAnuBAgQe1BmEcamiuSQUmsDtrpaKs/edit#gid=1064090175). tldr - after a 100x increase in txn fee, Flow will remain between 2-12x cheaper than rollups like Polygon, Base, Optimism, etc.
* Decentralization situation was asssesed (see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iII_X8hC5Vzx3jNz3oyIZtaW_aDpdeuOrulknPvV2oY/edit#gid=804968775)) after a16z pulled out from the plan to move nodes to BD. Tldr of new strategy - consolidate a16z stake across fewer CB nodes, spin up new FF/DL nodes, onboard new operators.

**This sprint**

- Publish forum post and gather community feedback
- Partner outreach regarding the upcoming transaction fee increase
- Draft and share FLIP on computation limit, G2C ratio and transaction fee increase for review
- Build consensus within Flow core team on which inflation strategy to employ
- Draft and share forum post on Inflation (stretch)
- Start node rebalancing to maintain decentralization (work with a16z, evaluate new operators)
- Keep the community updated (monthly GWG)
