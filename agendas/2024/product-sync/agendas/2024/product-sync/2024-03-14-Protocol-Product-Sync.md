   2. Discussion on how to adjust cruise-control parameters specifically in `Byzantine Fault Tolerance [BFT]` sub-working-group (schedule a meeting on April 4th?).
   3. Governance multi-sig and possible an update of the Epoch smart contract to deploy the new parameter set for Cruise Control [DRI: Vishal]
