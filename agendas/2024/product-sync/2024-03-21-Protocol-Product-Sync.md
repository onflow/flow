1. Hiring/ Recruitment </br>
   a. Probably need a TPM - Come up with a list of priorities, @Kan and @Sean would draft and share JD for this role. Check with UX WG's priorities </br>
   b. Engineering hires - plans to hire interns, young grads. Protocol should figure the engg resources we'd need. Young grads are preferred (for delegation);     senior hiring and onboarding is time-consuming
