# Overview

 ### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

 * React SDK is live with components
 * Cadence compiler + VM - basically no features left to support, started testing user Tx execution, testing execution correctness of book-keeping functions passed verification of 115K blocks.
* Badger -> Pebble migration - all node types being tested on testnet right now - very promising results so far! CPU spikes are gone, memory usage dropped from ~50% to under 10% (we need to wait longer to verify it is stable).
* EVM Gateway - completed work to increase TPS for high-traffic accounts & optimized key release logic to reduce the time the key becomes available.
* Network stress testing - loader improvements made it possible to sustain 300TPS load for 3 hours, promising collection thsize throttling results.
