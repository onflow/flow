# Overview

 ### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

 * First public app identified building with the newly released `@onflow/kit` library.

 * Closed - [Badger -> Pebble DB M2 - DB access refactoring for low-risk data (AN, EN, VN)](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/6527)
 * New TPS loader now runs automatically & [metrics are pushed to FF grafana](https://flowfoundation.grafana.net/goto/5zvXQvbNg?orgId=1).
 * added custom [linter](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/7271) to enforce conceptually immutable structs in `flow-go` are not modified
 * BN2 now supports private cadence builds as well as running existing images
