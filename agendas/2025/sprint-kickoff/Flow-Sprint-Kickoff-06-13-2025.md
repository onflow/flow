# Overview

 ### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

* Proof of Possession rolled out to mainnet.
* Strategy to transition 80%â€”90% of code from `feature/malleability` to master --
  significantly decreasing change surface for future conflicts until we can roll out breaking changes in Spork
* Closed Compiler + VM milestones 6 & 7 - running book-keeping functions (account balance check, storage limit check, fee deduction) speeds up execution by ~13%, with minimal effort spent on optimizations.
* Completed automatic fuzzing of parser & typechecker.
* Optimizations of version beacon access/use by the execution runtime improved execution saturation by ~30%.
* Grafana Alloy has been deployed to networks & BN2 for collecting profiles
* CloudFlare has been successfully moved to Business Plan
