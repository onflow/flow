# Overview

### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

- Forte is now live!
- We averted a crisis by ensuring network epoch transition succeeds and does not enter the Epoch Fallback Mode - thanks to Jordan S.
- Two content pieces are live - [Key deduplication](https://www.flow.com/engineering-blogs/optimizing-flow-for-scale-speed-and-sustainability) and [Data integrity](https://www.flow.com/engineering-blogs/advancing-protocol-autonomy-with-data-integrity)
- Fork testing is available
- 10 new hooks are live in the React SDK
- FlowALP Deployed to [Mainnet](https://www.flowview.app/account/0x6b00ff876c299c61/contract)!
