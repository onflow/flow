# Overview

### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

- Forte is now live!
- We averted a crisis by ensuring network epoch transition succeeds and does not enter the Epoch Fallback Mode - thanks to Jordan S.
- Published new technical blogs about [state optimization - account key deduplication](https://www.flow.com/engineering-blogs/optimizing-flow-for-scale-speed-and-sustainability) and nearly done with publishing [execution weight recalibration (notion link)](https://www.notion.so/flowfoundation/To-be-published-once-weights-are-live-Blog-post-for-Execution-Effort-Calibration-2-28d1aee1232480d090f6c87933bc69a6).
