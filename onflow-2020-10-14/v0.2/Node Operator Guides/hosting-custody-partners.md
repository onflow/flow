Outside of operating the Node software, one of the greatest challenges an operator will face is securely managing the Account that stake and rewards will be paid to and the Account Keys associated with it. Often the amount staked on your node will be large, and though those funds won't appear in your account while your node is in operation, when you unstake a Node, they will reappear in your account, so its security is paramount.

Our Custody partners will manage your Account Keys securely, allowing you access when you need it, and a safe place to leave them to collect rewards otherwise.
