Cadence is a language that is still early in development and we are actively working to add useful features to the language as well as the protocol to make it even easier to developers to build secure and powerful experiences on Flow.

Some of the language and development features that you can expect to see in the near future are:

* Support for fixed point decimal numbers
* Reworking of the account storage interface to make interacting with storage more intuitive
* Redesign of reference creation and interaction to make creating and using references more clear and easy
* Release of the Flow Go and Javascript client libraries so you can integrate smart contracts into real applications.

If you haven't looked yet, we highly recommend reading the [Glossary](doc:glossary)  and [FAQ](doc:faq) to learn even more about the details of the language. A full language reference is coming very soon!
