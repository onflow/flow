Welcome to the first public developer preview for Flow! Here you'll find initial documentation for Flow's smart contract programming language Cadence and five tutorials to build and test your first smart contracts. 

Before starting with these tutorials, we recommend reading the [Flow Primer](https://www.onflow.org/primer) where you will get a quick introduction to how the Flow blockchain works. It will be easier to understand the concepts in these tutorials if you have an idea of how Flow works.

Also, join our Discord channel! There you can directly speak with other members of the Flow community and Flow team to get support with your learning and projects.
