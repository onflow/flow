Flow is committed to a solid experience for its developers and operators. And sometimes the best experience is having to do as little as possible to get off the ground.

To help you along, Flow has partnered with several other teams to bring you some turnkey solutions to the most complex parts of operating Flow Nodes. These come as Node Hosting Providers, and Custody Providers.

Hosting Providers take on the grunt work of running the Node hardware and infrastructure, letting you earn block rewards and control a Node without having to provision a VM or worry about monitoring and infrastructure.

Our node hosting parters include: 
  - [ANKR](https://www.ankr.com/) 
  - [Bison Trails](https://bisontrails.co/)
  - [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/)

Outside of operating the Node software, one of the greatest challenges an operator will face is securely managing the Account that stake and rewards will be paid to and the Account Keys associated with it. Often the amount staked on your node will be large, and though those funds won't appear in your account while your node is in operation, when you unstake a Node, they will reappear in your account, so its security is paramount.

Our Custody partners will manage your Account Keys securely, allowing you access when you need it, and a safe place to leave them to collect rewards otherwise. Feel free to connect with either of the below for your custody needs on Flow.
